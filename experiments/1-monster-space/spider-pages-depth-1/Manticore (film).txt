They come to a small Iraqi town and find a man-eating monster instead. The soldiers find out that the residents of the town are dead and discover a living "Weapon of Mass Destruction", a Manticore. The Manticore was awakened from its long slumber by an Iraqi insurgent leader wanting to rid the country of foreign occupation forces at any price. The Manticore goes on a killing rampage and soon, the only ones left are Baxter, Keats, and Ashley Pierce. The Manticore kills Ashley by spitting acid on her face before eating her alive, but Baxter and Keats manage to kill it with a camcorder and a sledgehammer. Cast[edit] Robert Beltran as Sgt.
