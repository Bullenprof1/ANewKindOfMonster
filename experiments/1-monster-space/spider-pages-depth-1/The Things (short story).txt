Campbell's story "Who Goes There?") from the viewpoint of the alien. It was first published on Clarkesworld, in January 2010.

Reception[edit] The Things won the 2011 Shirley Jackson Award for Best Short Story,[1] and was a finalist for the 2011 Hugo Award for Best Short Story[2], the 2011 Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award,[3] and the 2011 BSFA Award for Best Short Fiction.[4] The audio version was a finalist for the 2010 Parsec Award for short fiction.[5] Wired called it "not only a startlingly effective portrayal of alien psychology, but also a thoughtful exploration of religion and the missionary impulse."[6] Publishers Weekly called it a depiction of "blindly expansionist colonialism".[7] Watts has reported being told by Simon Pegg that many members of the film's cast and crew enjoyed the story.[6] At Io9, Annalee Newitz praised it for "successfully represent(ing) a truly alien point of view", and called it "mind-bending".[8] Gardner Dozois similarly lauded Watts for his "excellent job of showing a totally alien way of looking at life", but noted that people who (like him) were more familiar with the 1951 film than with the 1982 remake "may be a little confused".[9] Chad Orzel was considerably more negative, calling it "far from impressive", with "two main weaknesses forced on the story by the basic concept": the extent to which it requires familiarity with the 1982 film, and Watts' effort to "basically retcon the goofy biology of the movie alien, which was based on the goofy biology of a John Campbell short story from the pulp magazine era."[10] References[edit] ^ Winners Announced for the 2010 Shirley Jackson Awards, at ShirleyJacksonAwards.org; published July 17, 2011; retrieved April 3, 2021 ^ 2011 Hugo Awards; at TheHugoAwards.org; retrieved April 3, 2021 ^ The Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award at the J.
