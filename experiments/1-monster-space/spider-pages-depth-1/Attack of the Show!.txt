The show originally aired live five days a week; the week of January 2, 2006 (2006-01-02), the show was truncated to air for only four days a week. Fridays featured a "Mash Up" that compiled segments from the week's four live shows. The show returned to live shows five days a week in September 2008, but G4 announced as of March 2, 2009 (2009-03-02), Attack of the Show! would go to four days a week with a "best of" show running in the Friday time-slot. Attack of the Show! aired its 1,000th episode on July 9, 2009 (2009-07-09).[3] Attack of the Show! upgraded to high-definition on April 5, 2010 (2010-04-05) to coincide with its first-ever "Epic April" event of new premieres and stunts. Along with the addition of Candace Bailey, on January 11, 2011 (2011-01-11), Attack of the Show "respawned" with new graphics and a new set.[4] On October 26, 2012. G4 canceled Attack of the Show! due to low ratings, five months after Kevin Pereira canceled his contract. The series taped its final scenes on December 21, 2012, and its final episode was broadcast January 23, 2013. On December 29, 2019, NBC's San Francisco-owned station KNTV aired a 30-minute special titled Best of Attack of the Show at 2:00am.[5] While a slate at the top of the special said "This program originally aired on May 31, 2012," the special itself did not air on G4 that day, and it contained various clips from episodes past this date. NBC.com later put this special online, incorrectly citing that the special first aired on December 26, 2019 [6] On January 28, 2021, G4 (that announced its return six months earlier) announced that Attack of the Show! would be returning due to high demands from fans and will premiere on the revival of the network in summer 2021.[7] Three weeks later, they announced that Kevin Pereira would return to host Attack of the Show!.[8] Personnel[edit] This section may be confusing or unclear to readers.

(January 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Munn and Pereira on a panel for Attack of the Show! at the 2008 Comic Con in San Diego, California. Host Kevin Rose left the G4 Network and AOTS on May 22, 2005 (2005-05-22). The show announced a search for a new host among the show's audience, and for several months various candidates auditioned on the air. In the end none of the candidates were actually selected, although this was never actually announced on the air. Sarah Lane, who had previously been a co-host and segment contributor, gradually became the show's official host alongside Kevin Pereira. She continued in this capacity until April 6, 2006 (2006-04-06), when she and Brendan Moran announced their engagement and stated that they would be leaving the show.[9] The Morans appeared on the show, via satellite, on July 13, 2006 (2006-07-13), to talk about their adventures. Olivia Munn was hired to replace Lane and began hosting with Kevin Pereira on Monday, April 10, 2006 (2006-04-10). Zach Selwyn, the runner up on ESPN's Dream Job, was hired to replace Moran and started his hosting duties a week later on April 17, 2006 (2006-04-17). Munn said at the 2010 Comic Con that she would not be leaving AOTS, though she only occasionally appeared on the show for the rest of that year. She was still featured in the opening credits and other AOTS set pieces and transitions until December 6, 2010 (2010-12-06). Candace Bailey in the production of an Attack of the Show! episode in January 2011. Candace Bailey and Sara Jean Underwood with a fan After the departure of Munn, AOTS featured several guest co-hosts including: Candace Bailey, Jessica Chobot, Alison Haislip, Carrie Keagan, Alessandra Torresani, Sara Underwood, Milynn Sarley, and Morgan Webb. Bailey became the new co-host with Pereira on January 11, 2011 (2011-01-11).[10] AOTS has also featured Chris Hardwick, Chris Gore, and Blair Herter in the occasional absence of Kevin Pereira. In addition to the interim cohosts, Grace Helbig has also filled in for Candace Bailey. On May 9, 2012 (2012-05-09), Kevin Pereira announced on-air that he was officially leaving AOTS to pursue work in television production. He stated, "I plan to turn my attention to full-time with my production company Super Creative and live touring nerd-carnival leetUP." His last day on AOTS was May 31.[11] Beginning August 28, 2012 (2012-08-28), the show debuted a final new opening credit, with no reference to permanent or guest hosts. Kevin Pereira himself hosted the game show Let's Ask America since the September 17, 2012 series debut. On October 26, 2012 (2012-10-26), G4 announced that they would not renew AOTS at the end of the year, as part of an eventual rebranding of the channel itself. On January 23, 2013 (2013-01-23), Attack of the Show! televised its final original episode on G4. After a brief montage of clips from AOTS history and final goodbyes from the show's hosts and staff, the series ended with former Screen Savers hosts Patrick Norton and Leo Laporte in a coffee shop, acting as if the entire run of AOTS had been a dream. They then don "rocket packs" and fly off to work in a skyscraper adorned with the old TechTV logo, as the Screen Savers theme plays one last time and the G4 Media copyright box appears in the bottom left corner of the screen. Afterwards, text came up on the screen against a gray background that read, "To our fans, our haters, and the Internet, thanks for seven kick-ass years. TTYL, Attack of the Show," with the Attack of the Show! theme playing at the end.[12] On February 8, 2013 (2013-02-08), Attack of the Show! aired for the final time as a scheduled program on G4, with the final original episode being re-aired. Some of the video clips of the show can still be seen on YouTube[13] though their YouTube account is no longer visible. The official Attack of the Show! webpage, along with the rest of g4tv.com, is no longer online.
