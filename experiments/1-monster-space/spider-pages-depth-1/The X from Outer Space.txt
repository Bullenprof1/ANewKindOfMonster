When the spaceship arrives, it comes across a mysterious alien vessel that suddenly sprays the AAB Gamma with spores. Samples are returned to Earth, where one of them begins to develop. The spore grows into a giant, lizard-like creature that is named "Guilala". The monster begins a reign of destruction through Tokyo. It spits fireballs, feeds on nuclear fuel, turns into a flying, burning sphere, and destroys all aircraft and tanks in its path. Guilala is finally defeated by fighter jets laden with bombs, which coat it in a substance called "Guilalalium". This causes Guilala to shrink down to its original spore form. The government promptly launches it back into space, where it will circle the Sun in an endless orbit. Cast[edit] Toshiya Wazaki as Captain K.

X fits comfortably into one's stoned best-bad-movie rental evening".[11] See also[edit] Monster X Strikes Back: Attack the G8 Summit List of Japanese films of 1967 List of science fiction films of the 1960s References[edit] Footnotes[edit] ^ a b c d e f "The X from Outer Space".
