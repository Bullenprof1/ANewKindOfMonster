Dragon-like creature from Mesopotamian mythology MuÅ¡á¸«uÅ¡Å¡u ð’ˆ²ð’„­ð’„Š MuÅ¡á¸«uÅ¡Å¡u holding a gate post on a vase of Gudea c.â€‰2100 BCE. Louvre Museum[1] Grouping Mythological hybrid Other name(s) Sirrush Region Mesopotamia Sirrush bas-relief in the Pergamon Museum The muÅ¡á¸«uÅ¡Å¡u (ð’ˆ²ð’„­ð’„Š; formerly also read as sirruÅ¡u or sirrush) or mushkhushshu (pronouncedÂ [muÊƒxuÊƒÊƒu] or [musxussu]), is a creature from ancient Mesopotamian mythology. A mythological hybrid, it is a scaly animal with hind legs resembling the talons of an eagle, lion-like forelimbs, a long neck and tail, a horned head, a snake-like tongue, and a crest. The muÅ¡á¸«uÅ¡Å¡u most famously appears on the reconstructed Ishtar Gate of the city of Babylon, dating to the sixth century BCE. The form muÅ¡á¸«uÅ¡Å¡u is the Akkadian nominative of Sumerian: ð’ˆ²ð’„­ð’„Š MUÅ .á¸ªUS, 'reddish snake', sometimes also translated as 'fierce snake'.[2] One author,[3] possibly following others, translates it as 'splendor serpent' (ð’ˆ² MUÅ  is the Sumerian term for 'serpent'). The reading sir-ruÅ¡Å¡u is due to a mistransliteration of the cuneiform in early Assyriology.[4] Contents 1 History 2 See also 3 References 4 Notes 5 External links History[edit] MuÅ¡á¸«uÅ¡Å¡u already appears in Sumerian religion and art, as in the "Libation vase of Gudea", dedicated to Ningishzida by the Sumerian ruler Gudea (21st century BCE short chronology).[1][5] The muÅ¡á¸«uÅ¡Å¡u is the sacred animal of Marduk and his son Nabu during the Neo-Babylonian Empire. The dragon MuÅ¡á¸«uÅ¡Å¡u, whom Marduk once vanquished, became his symbolic animal and servant.[6] It was taken over by Marduk from Tishpak, the local god of Eshnunna.[7] The constellation Hydra was known in Babylonian astronomical texts as BaÅ¡mu, 'the Serpent' (ð’€¯ð’ˆ², MUL.dMUÅ ). It was depicted as having the torso of a fish, the tail of a snake, the forepaws of a lion, the hind legs of an eagle, wings, and a head comparable to the muÅ¡á¸«uÅ¡Å¡u.[8][9] 9th century BCE depiction of the Statue of Marduk, with his servant dragon MuÅ¡á¸«uÅ¡Å¡u at his feet.
