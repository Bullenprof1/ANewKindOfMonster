Avoid."[3] Reviewers for Electronic Gaming Monthly criticized the gameplay, believing it to be inadequate.[6] Mean Machines praised the variety and considered the game to be adequately difficult, but criticism was directed at the graphics, sound, and lack of originality.[4] In a later review, Skyler Miller of AllGame criticized the graphics and called the game's difficulty "grueling to the point of frustration", although she stated that the Ghostbusters theme music was well done.[5] Notes[edit] ^ In Electronic Gaming Monthly's review, two critics gave it a 4/10, one a 3/10, and another a 5/10.[6] ^ Nintendo Power gave Ghostbusters II 3.1/5 for graphics/sound, 2.9/5 for theme/fun, and two 2.6/5 scores for play control and challenge.[8] References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i Imagineering (1990).
