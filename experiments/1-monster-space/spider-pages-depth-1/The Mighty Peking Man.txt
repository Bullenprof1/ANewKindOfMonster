Both were produced by the legendary Runme Shaw, who, having tasted greatness, obviously hoped to repeat. I find to my astonishment that I gave Infra-Man only two and a half stars when I reviewed it. That was 22 years ago, but a fellow will remember a lot of things you wouldn't think he'd remember. I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that film. I am awarding Mighty Peking Man three stars, for general goofiness and a certain level of insane genius, but I cannot in good conscience rate it higher than Infra-Man. So, in answer to those correspondents who ask if I have ever changed a rating on a movie: Yes, Infra-Man moves up to three stars.[6] Footnotes[edit] ^ a b c d e Willis 1985, p. 321: "Review is of a Cantonese-language 100 minute version viewed in Hong Kong on April 10, 1977" sfn error: no target: CITEREFWillis1985 (help) ^ "Evelyne Kraft: Swedish Jungle Girl". themastercylinder.com.
