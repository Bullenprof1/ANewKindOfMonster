T. Joshi, Richard Selzer, Earl Hamner, Jr., and more, both from Cycatrix Press. Nolan teamed up with Bluewater Productions for a comic book series, Logan's Run: Last Day, released in 2010. In addition, he developed comics based on one other property of his for Bluewater: Tales from William F. Nolan's Dark Universe (featuring stories adapted by Nolan and Brock and published in 2013). Another comic book mini-series Sam Space (forthcoming) has been scripted and approved. Among his many accolades, Nolan has twice won the Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America.[1] He was voted a Living Legend in Dark Fantasy by the International Horror Guild in 2002, and in 2006 was bestowed the honorary title of Author Emeritus by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. In 2010, he received the Lifetime Achievement Bram Stoker Award from the Horror Writers Association (HWA). In 2013 he was a recipient, along with Brian W. Aldiss, of the World Fantasy Convention Award in Brighton, England by the World Fantasy Convention. In May 2014, Nolan was presented with another Bram Stoker Award, for Superior Achievement in Nonfiction; this was for his collection about his late friend Ray Bradbury, called Nolan on Bradbury: Sixty Years of Writing about the Master of Science Fiction.[5] In 2015, Nolan was named a World Horror Society Grand Master; the award was presented at the World Horror Convention in Atlanta, GA in May of that year.[6] Personal life[edit] Nolan was born in Kansas City, Missouri to Irish Catholic parents.[1] He briefly attended the Kansas City Art Institute. Later, he worked for Hallmark Cards, Inc. writing verse and illustrating greeting cards before moving to California with his parents. After a few years working in offices, he met Charles Beaumont, who would remain a close friend until Beaumont's untimely death at age thirty-eight.[1] Beaumont was instrumental in Nolan becoming an author. Nolan was also a close friend to Norman Corwin and Ray Bradbury and was a member of the influential Southern California School of Writers in the 1950s-1960s (known informally as "The Group"), many of whom wrote for Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Twilight Zone, Star Trek, and other popular series of the day. Nolan is an ethical vegetarian and loves animals. He still writes new material and is active in various literary projects, conventions (he was Guest of Honor at Killer Con, and at Portland's Orycon, as well as a special guest at the World Horror Convention, World Fantasy Convention, and many others), and promotional opportunities. Though estranged for more than ten years, he has been married since 1970. He resides in Vancouver, WA. With regard to his work, he stated: "I get excited about something, and I want to write about it."[7] Appearances: Films, TV & Documentaries[edit] The Intruder (1962) as villain "Bart Carey" Charles Beaumont: The Life of Twilight Zone’s Magic Man (JaSunni Productions, LLC; 2010) as himself The AckerMonster Chronicles!
