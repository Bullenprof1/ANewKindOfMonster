The large and varied geographical territory takes in rural and upland areas, market towns such as Lanark, Strathaven and Carluke, the urban burghs of Rutherglen, Cambuslang, and East Kilbride which was Scotland's first new town. The area was formed in 1996 from the areas of Clydesdale,[1] Hamilton and East Kilbride districts, and some outer areas of Glasgow district (Rutherglen/Fernhill, Cambuslang/Halfway and part of King's Park/Toryglen); all were previously within the Strathclyde region from 1975 but in historic Lanarkshire prior to that.[2][3][4][5] Leadership[edit] South Lanarkshire operates a cabinet style system, with key decisions being taken by the Executive Committee, under the leadership of the Council Leader,[6] and approved by the council, led by the provost. The first leader of South Lanarkshire Council, selected from among the sitting councillors, was Tom McCabe who previously held the same office at Hamilton District.[7] When McCabe was elected as an MSP in 1999, the role went to his deputy Eddie McAvoy - brother of one of the region's MPs Tommy McAvoy - who held the post for the next 18 years until his retirement ahead of the 2017 election.[8][9] The new leader from 2017 was John Ross.[10] The ambassadorial role of provost is also filled by one of the serving councillors.[11] Office holders include: Sam Casserly (1995-1999) - previous provost of Hamilton district[7][12] Alan Dick (1999-2003)[13] Mushtaq Ahmad (2003-2007)[14] Russell Clearie (2007-2012)[15][16] Eileen Logan (2012-2017) - previous provost of Clydesdale district[17][18] Ian McAllan (2017-)[19] Political composition[edit] Party Councillors[20] Scottish National Party 24 Labour 17 Conservative 13 Independent 6 Liberal Democrats 3 Elections[edit] 1995 South Lanarkshire Council election 1999 South Lanarkshire Council election 2003 South Lanarkshire Council election 2007 South Lanarkshire Council election 2012 South Lanarkshire Council election 2017 South Lanarkshire Council election Wards[edit] In the council's initial 12 years, individual wards (73 in 1995, adjusted down to 67 in 1999 and 2003) each electing one councillor using the First past the post method.[21][22] Since the 2007 South Lanarkshire Council election, there are 20 council wards in South Lanarkshire,[23] each serving a population ranging from 12,000 to 19,000[24] and each ward represented on the council by 3 or 4 councillors elected using single transferable vote; in 2007 and 2012 this produced a total of 67 available seats, which was adjusted down to 64 in 2017 along with boundary adjustments, although the same number of wards overall.

The 17 storey, 165 feet (50 m) tower is the largest in Hamilton, is Category A-listed, and is a highly visible landmark across this part of the Clyde Valley. The modernist design was influenced by the United Nations building in New York City. Glass curtain walls cover the north and south facades, with the narrow east and west sides being blank white walls. At the front of the building is the circular council chamber, and a plaza with water features. It is known by locals as the "County Buildings".
