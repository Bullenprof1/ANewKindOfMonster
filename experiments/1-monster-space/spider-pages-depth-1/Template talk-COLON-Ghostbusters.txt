You can always change it back. Animedude 22:07, 20 April 2006 (UTC) I agree; this is much better, both from an aesthetic standpoint and from a usability one. Good job. EVula 22:32, 20 April 2006 (UTC) Ghostbusters III[edit] I removed Ghostbusters III from the template. That entry has been deleted multiple times (see the deletion discussion here) and despite the constant clouds of rumor any possible sequel won't merit an article unless the movie is actually announced by an official source. Until then, it shouldn't be in this list. Rob T Firefly 16:01, 12 June 2007 (UTC) And I just did it again. Since Ghostbusters III has been merged and redirected to the main Ghostbusters (franchise) article, the link in the template is unnecessary. Rob T Firefly 18:58, 13 August 2007 (UTC) Characters vs. Main Characters[edit] Which term is better? Got reverted for no reason [1] and would like some input. NintendoFan (Talk, Contribs) 14:19, 12 February 2014 (UTC) Why change it for no reason? "Characters" is perfectly fine. --Rob Sinden (talk) 14:21, 12 February 2014 (UTC) There over 2 dozen known characters on the show. "Main Characters" make it a little more clear. Otherwise we'll start adding Slimer, the Sandman, etc. NintendoFan (Talk, Contribs) 14:23, 12 February 2014 (UTC) Well, if there were articles for those characters, then it would be appropriate to add them to the navbox. And it's debatable whether the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man (or Janine for that matter) is a "main" character. None of them are "main cast", that's for sure, which is what you'd originally changed the heading to!!! --Rob Sinden (talk) 14:25, 12 February 2014 (UTC) The "main cast" are the four Ghostbusters and characters that appear in every show, such as Slimer and Janine. The Stay-Puff marshmallow man is prolly an icon of the series, but including him is open for debate. NintendoFan (Talk, Contribs) 07:20, 14 February 2014 (UTC) Then we leave it at "Characters". --Rob Sinden (talk) 09:11, 14 February 2014 (UTC) Zuul[edit] The dinosaur Zuul was named after the creature in the film, for resembling those weird demon dogs. Dan Aykroyd even featured in a video about it.[2] Does it warrant listing under miscellaneous? FunkMonk (talk) 13:05, 27 September 2019 (UTC) Is say yes, as a significant example of the franchise influencing the larger world. It speaks to the notability and popularity of the franchise (not that there was ever any doubt as to either). oknazevad (talk) 18:13, 27 September 2019 (UTC) Cool, added.
