He specializes in incidental music for media such as television and film. Active since the early 1960s, he has been one of Japan's most highly demanded film and TV composers, working principally on tokusatsu and anime productions for children, as well as violent action films, jidaigeki and television dramas. Kikuchi has been inactive since 2017, when he stated that he was taking a break to be treated for an illness.[1] Contents 1 Career 2 Awards 3 Selected works 4 References 5 External links Career[edit] After graduating from the Nihon University College of Art, he made his debut composing for the 1961 film The Eighth Enemy (八人目の敵).[2] The Tō-Ō Nippō Press wrote that the contrast between the heroic opening theme and the melancholic ballad ending theme that Kikuchi composed for the 1969 Tiger Mask anime, "changed Japanese anime music."[2] The Tō-Ō Nippō Press also wrote that the success of the TV drama Abarenbō Shōgun, which aired for 800 episodes from 1978 to 2008, had people say; "If Shunsuke Kikuchi is in charge of the music, the show will be a hit."[2] In 1979 Kikuchi composed "Doraemon no Uta", the theme song of the Doraemon anime, which ran on TV for 26 years.[2] Up-tempo works like those in Kamen Rider and Abarenbō Shōgun form the majority of Kikuchi's works, while his slow background music from long-running series have become some of his best-known works. Works that he composed for, such as anime and tokusatsu like Doraemon, Kamen Rider, Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, jidaigeki such as Abarenbō Shōgun and Chōshichirō Edo Nikki, and TBS Saturday-night productions ranging from Key Hunter to G-Men '75 became long-running hit series. The song "Urami Bushi" (怨み節) which he composed for the early 1970s Female Convict Scorpion series was included in the American film Kill Bill and on its soundtrack. Awards[edit] Kikuchi was nominated for the Japan Academy Prize for Music in 1983 for his work on The Gate of Youth and To Trap a Kidnapper. He received an Award of Merit at the 2013 Tokyo Anime Awards.[3] Kikuchi has won several annual awards from the Japanese Society for Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers based on the royalties he earned from his works in the previous year. He won the International Award, which is based on foreign income, in 1983 (UFO Robot Grendizer), 1989 (UFO Robot Grendizer), 2008 (Dragon Ball Z), 2010 (Doraemon), 2012 (Doraemon), 2015 (Dragon Ball Z), 2016 (Kiteretsu Daihyakka), 2018 (Dragon Ball Z), and 2019 (Dragon Ball Z). He came in second in overall royalties in 2004 (Dragon Ball Z).[4] In 2015, he received a lifetime achievement award at the 57th Japan Record Awards.[5] Selected works[edit] Abare Hasshū Goyō Tabi Abarenbō Shōgun Arabian Nights: Sinbad's Adventures Babel II Casshan[6] Chōshichirō Edo Nikki Daimos Danguard Ace Denjin Zaborger Doraemon (1979 anime) Dotakon Dr. Slump and Arale-chan[6] Dragon Ball Dragon Ball Z Dragon Ball: Yo!
