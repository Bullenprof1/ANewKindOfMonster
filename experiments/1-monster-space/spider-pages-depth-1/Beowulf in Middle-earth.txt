The royal palace of Rohan, Meduseld, is a Viking-style mead hall, like Hrothgar's hall, Heorot, described in Beowulf. Depicted is a reconstructed Viking longhouse in Denmark. J. R. R. Tolkien, a fantasy author and professional philologist, drew on the Old English poem Beowulf for multiple aspects of his Middle-earth legendarium, both in terms of elements such as names, monsters, and the structure of society in a heroic age, in terms of style such as creating an impression of depth and adopting an elegiac tone, and in terms of its larger but hidden symbolism. The names of races including ents, orcs, and elves, and placenames such as Orthanc and Meduseld, derive from Beowulf. The were-bear Beorn in The Hobbit has been likened to the hero Beowulf himself; both names mean "bear" and both characters have enormous strength. Scholars have compared some of Tolkien's monsters to those in Beowulf. Both his trolls and Gollum share attributes with Grendel, while Smaug's characteristics closely match those of the Beowulf dragon. Tolkien's Riders of Rohan are distinctively Old English, and he has made use of multiple elements of Beowulf in creating them, including their language, culture, and poetry. Tolkien admired the way that Beowulf, written by a Christian looking back at a pagan past, embodied a "large symbolism"[1] without ever becoming allegorical. That symbolism, of life's road and individual heroism, Tolkien worked to echo in The Lord of the Rings.

The tale is told in a roundabout way with many digressions into history and legend, and with a constant elegiac tone, ending in a dirge. It was written by a Christian poet, looking back reflectively on a time already in his people's distant past.[2] J. R. R. Tolkien was an English author and philologist of ancient Germanic languages, specialising in Old English; he spent much of his career as a professor at the University of Oxford.[3] He is best known for his novels about his invented Middle-earth, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. He was a devout Roman Catholic, and described The Lord of the Rings as "a fundamentally religious and Catholic work", rich in Christian symbolism.[4] Beowulf was in the Tolkien scholar and fellow philologist Tom Shippey's words "the single work which influenced Tolkien most".[5] He made use of it in his Middle-earth legendarium in multiple ways: in specific story-elements such as monsters; in Old English culture, as seen in the Kingdom of Rohan; in the aesthetic style of The Lord of the Rings, with its impression of depth and its elegiac tone; and in its "large symbolism".[6] People[edit] Further information: J. R. R. Tolkien's influences § Beowulf A philologist's races[edit] Beowulf's eotenas [ond] ylfe [ond] orcneas, "ogres [and] elves [and] devil-corpses" helped to inspire Tolkien to create Orcs, Elves, and other races.[7] Tolkien made use of his philological expertise on Beowulf to create some of the races of Middle-earth. The list of supernatural creatures in Beowulf, eotenas ond ylfe ond orcnéas, "ettens [giants] and elves and demon-corpses", contributed to his Orcs, and Elves, and to an allusion to Ettens in his "Ettenmoors" placename.[7] His tree-giants or Ents (etymologically close to Ettens) may derive from a phrase in another Old English poem, Maxims II, orþanc enta geweorc, "skilful work of giants";[7] the Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey suggests that Tolkien took the name of the tower of Orthanc (orþanc) from the same phrase, reinterpreted as "Orthanc, the Ents' fortress".[8] Characters[edit] Beowulfian: Bödvar Bjarki shifts shape to fight in the form of a bear, as Tolkien's Beorn does.[9] Painting by Louis Moe, 1898 The word orþanc occurs again in Beowulf, alongside the term searo in the phrase searonet seowed, smiþes orþancum, "a cunning-net sewn, by a smith's skill", meaning a mail-shirt or byrnie. Tolkien used searo in its Mercian form *saru for the name of Orthanc's ruler, the wizard Saruman, whose name could thus be translated "cunning man", incorporating the ideas of subtle knowledge and technology into Saruman's character.[8][10] An especially Beowulfian character appears in The Hobbit as Beorn; his name originally meant "Bear" but came to mean "Man, Warrior", giving Tolkien the chance to make the character a were-bear, able to shift his shape between man and animal. A bear-man Bödvar Bjarki exists in Norse myth, while it is Beowulf himself whom Beorn echoes in the Old English poem. The name "Beowulf" can indeed be read as "the Bees' Wolf", that is, "the Honey-Eater", in other words "the Bear", the man who is so strong that he snaps swords and tears off the arms of monsters with his enormous bear-like strength. Shippey notes that Beorn is ferocious, rude, and cheerful, characteristics that reflect his huge inner self-confidence—itself an aspect of northern heroic courage.[9] Monsters[edit] Further information: Tolkien's monsters Scholars have compared several of Tolkien's monsters, including his Trolls, Gollum, and Smaug, to those in Beowulf.[11][12][13] Trolls[edit] Tolkien's wordless trolls have been compared to Grendel, a monster in Beowulf.[11] Illustration by J. R. Skelton, 1908 Further information: Troll (Middle-earth) Beowulf's first fight is with the monster Grendel, who is often taken by scholars as a kind of troll from Norse mythology. The Trolls in The Lord of the Rings share some of Grendel's attributes, such as great size and strength, being more or less wordless, impervious to ordinary swords, and favouring the night. Christina Fawcett suggests that Tolkien's "roaring Troll" in The Return of the King reflects Grendel's "firey eye and terrible screaming."[11] Noting that Tolkien compares them to beasts as they "came striding up, roaring like beasts ... bellowing", she observes that they "remain wordless warriors, like Grendel", although they are sentient, with intelligence and a single language, unlike the varied tongues of Tolkien's orcs.[11] Gollum[edit] Further information: Gollum Gollum, a far smaller monster in Middle-earth, has also been likened to Grendel, with his preference for hunting with his bare hands and his liking for desolate, marshy places. The many parallels between these monsters include their affinity for water, their isolation from society, and their bestial description.[14] Verlyn Flieger suggests that he is Tolkien's central monster-figure, likening him to both Grendel and the dragon, "the twisted, broken, outcast hobbit whose manlike shape and dragonlike greed combine both the Beowulf kinds of monster in one figure".[12] Flieger's comparison of Gollum with Grendel and the Beowulf dragon[12] Grendel Gollum the Beowulf dragon Man-eating Cannibalistic, eats goblins, hobbits if no fish to eat — "Outcast, a wanderer in the waste, of the race of Cain" Murderer, outcast — Unable to bear the sound of human pleasure with harp music A small corner of his mind could still enjoy "a kindly voice... but that ... would only make the evil part of him angrier in the end[15] — — Greed for the Ring Greed for treasure — Transformed by greed for ring into a creeping thing, his OE name Smeagol meaning "creeping" (Fafnir changed himself into a dragon to guard his gold and his ring) — His name for the ring, "Precious" is OE māþum māþum is dragon's hoard Smaug[edit] Further information: Smaug § The Beowulf dragon Tolkien made use of the Beowulf dragon to create one of his most distinctive monsters, the dragon in The Hobbit, Smaug. The Beowulf dragon is aroused and enraged by the theft of a golden cup from his pile of treasure; he flies out in the night and destroys Beowulf's hall; he is killed, but the treasure is cursed, and Beowulf too dies. In The Hobbit, the eponymous Hobbit protagonist Bilbo accordingly steals a golden cup from the dragon's huge mound of treasure, awakening Smaug, who flies out and burns Laketown; the allure of gold is too much of a temptation for the Dwarf Thorin, who is killed soon afterwards.[16][17] On the other hand, the Beowulf dragon does not speak; Tolkien has made Smaug conversational, and wily with it.[18] Stuart D. Lee and Elizabeth Solopova analyse the parallels between Smaug and the unnamed Beowulf dragon:[13] Lee and Solopova's comparison of Smaug and the Beowulf dragon[13] Plot element Beowulf The Hobbit Aggressive dragon eald uhtsceaða ... hat ond hreohmod ... Wæs þæs wyrmes wig / wide gesyne "old twilight-ravager ... hot and fierce-minded" ... "that worm's war was / widely seen" Smaug fiercely attacks Dwarves, Laketown Gold-greedy dragon hordweard "treasure-guardian" Smaug watchfully sleeps on pile of treasure Provoking the dragon wæs ða gebolgen / beorges hyrde, wolde se laða / lige forgyldan drincfæt dyre. "was then furious / the barrow's keeper wanted the enemy / with fire to revenge precious drinking-cup."

Secret passage to Smaug's lair and mound of treasure in stone palace under Mount Erebor Accursed dragon-gold hæðnum horde "a heathen hoard" The treasure provokes Battle of Five Armies Culture of Rohan[edit] Further information: Rohan (Middle-earth) "Great horns of the North wildly blowing",[19] embodying the "heroic Northern world".[20] Depicted is the great aurochs hunting horn of Sigismund III Vasa. Names and language[edit] Tolkien made use of Beowulf, along with other Old English sources, for many aspects of the Riders of Rohan. Their land was the Mark, its name a version of the Mercia where he lived, in Mercian dialect *Marc. Their names are straightforwardly Old English: Éomer and Hama (characters in Beowulf), Éowyn ("Horse-joy"), Théoden ("King"). So too is their language, with words like Éothéod ("Horse-people"), Éored ("Troop of cavalry"), and Eorlingas ("people of Eorl", whose name means "[Horse-]lord", cf. Earl), where many words and names begin with the word for "horse", eo[h].[21] There are even spoken phrases: "'Westu Théoden hál!' cried Éomer" is, Alaric Hall notes, a scholarly joke, a dialectal form of Beowulf's Wæs þú, Hróðgár, hál ("Be thou well, Hrothgar!") i.e. Éomer shouts "Long Live King Theoden!" in a Mercian accent. Tolkien chose to use the West Midlands spelling of Old English, since he had been brought up in that region.[10] The linguist Michael Kennedy published an analysis of all the uses Tolkien made of Beowulf for the Rohirric language in a 2001 article in the Amon Hen journal.[22] Heroic culture[edit] Théoden's hall, Meduseld (the word means "mead hall" in Beowulf), is modelled on Beowulf's Heorot, as is the way it is guarded, visitors being repeatedly but courteously challenged. Heorot's golden thatched roof is described in line 311 of Beowulf which Tolkien directly translates as a description of Meduseld: "The light of it shines far over the land", representing líxte se léoma ofer landa fela.[23] The warhorns of the Riders of Rohan exemplify, in Shippey's view, the "heroic Northern world", as in what he calls the nearest Beowulf has to a moment of Tolkien-like eucatastrophe, when Ongentheow's Geats, trapped all night, hear the horns of Hygelac's men coming to rescue them; the Riders blow their horns wildly as they finally arrive, turning the tide of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields at a climactic moment in The Lord of the Rings.[20][19] Alliterative verse[edit] Further information: Poetry in The Lord of the Rings Among the many poems in The Lord of the Rings are some fine examples of Tolkien's skill in imitating Old English alliterative verse, keeping strictly to the metrical structure, which he described in his essay On Translating Beowulf.[10][24][25] Mark Hall compares Aragorn's lament for Boromir to Scyld Scefing's ship-burial in Beowulf:[26] Mark Hall's comparison of the "Lament for Boromir" with the ship-burial in Beowulf[26] Beowulf 2:36b–42 Scyld Scefing's funeral Hall's Translation "Lament for Boromir"[27] (floated in a boat down the Anduin to the Falls of Rauros)                         þær wæs madma fela of feorwegum     frætwa gelæded; ne hyrde ic cymlicor    ceol gegyrwan hildewæpnum     ond heaðowædum, billum ond byrnum;     him on bearme læg madma mænigo,    þa him mid scoldon on flodes æht    feor gewitan.                         There was much treasure from faraway     ornaments brought not heard I of more nobly     a ship prepared war-weapons     and war-armour sword and mail;     on his lap lay treasures many     then with him should on floods' possession     far departed. 'Beneath Amon Hen I heard his cry.      There many foes he fought. His cloven shield, his broken sword,      they to the water brought. His head so proud, his face so fair,       his limbs they laid to rest; And Rauros, golden Rauros-falls,      bore him upon its breast.' Style[edit] Impression of depth[edit] The many digressions in Beowulf must have given its listeners a powerful impression of looking into a noble pagan past.[28] Illustration by J. R. Skelton, c. 1910 Main article: Impression of depth in The Lord of the Rings A quality of literature that Tolkien particularly prized was the impression of depth, of hidden vistas into ancient history. He found this especially in Beowulf, but also in other works that he admired, such as Virgil's Aeneid, Shakespeare's Macbeth, Sir Orfeo, and Grimms' Fairy Tales.[29] Beowulf contains numerous digressions into other stories which have functions other than advancing the story, in Adrien Bonjour's words rendering "the background of the poem extraordinarily alive",[30][b] and providing contrasts and examples that repeatedly illuminate the key points of the main story with flashes of the distant past.[30] Tolkien stated in The Monsters and the Critics that Beowulf:[28] must have succeeded admirably in creating in the minds of the poet's contemporaries the illusion of surveying a past, pagan but noble and fraught with a deep significance - a past that itself had depth and reached backward into a dark antiquity of sorrow. This impression of depth is an effect and a justification of the use of episodes and allusions to old tales, mostly darker, more pagan, and desperate than the foreground".[28] In addition, Tolkien valued particularly the "shimmer of suggestion" that never exactly becomes explicit, but that constantly hints at greater depth. That is just as in Beowulf, where Tolkien described the quality as the "glamour of Poesis",[31] though whether this was, Shippey notes, an effect of distance in time, the "elvish hone of antiquity", or a kind of memory or vision of paradise is never distinguished.[32] Elegiac tone[edit] Further information: Decline and fall in Middle-earth § Fading The Lord of the Rings, especially its last two books in The Return of the King, has a consistent elegiac tone, in this resembling Beowulf.[33] The Tolkien scholar Marjorie Burns describes it as a "sense of inevitable disintegration".[34] Patrice Hannon calls it "a story of loss and longing, punctuated by moments of humor and terror and heroic action but on the whole a lament for a world—albeit a fictional world—that has passed even as we seem to catch a last glimpse of it flickering and fading...".[35] "Large symbolism"[edit] Shippey notes that Tolkien wrote of Beowulf that the "large symbolism is near the surface, but ... does not break through, nor become allegory",[1] for if it did, that would constrain the story, like that of The Lord of the Rings, to have just one meaning. That sort of constraint was something that Tolkien "contemptuously" dismissed in his foreword to the second edition, stating that he preferred applicability, giving readers freedom to read into the novel what they could see in it. The message could be hinted at, repeatedly, and they would work, Shippey writes, "only if they were true both in fact and in fiction";[1] Tolkien set out to make The Lord of the Rings work the same way.[1] The road of life[edit] The Old Walking Song, sung as the hobbits set out on their journey from the Shire, and indeed the whole of The Lord of the Rings, can be seen as symbolising the journey of life.[36] Further information: The Road Goes Ever On (song) The symbolism can be glimpsed in many places, illuminating different aspects. Tolkien's poem The Old Walking Song is repeated, with variations, three times in The Lord of the Rings. The last version contains the words "The Road goes ever on and on / Out from the door where it began. ... But I at last with weary feet / Will turn towards the lighted inn". Shippey writes that "if 'the lighted inn' on the road means death, then 'the Road' must mean life", and the poem and the novel could be speaking of the process of psychological individuation. Beowulf, too, concerns the life and death of its hero.[36][37][38] Flieger writes that Tolkien saw Beowulf as "a poem of balance, the opposition of ends and beginnings":[39] the young Beowulf rises, sails to Denmark, kills Grendel, becomes King; many years later, the old Beowulf falls, killing the dragon but going to his own death. In Flieger's view, Tolkien has built the same values, balance, and opposition into The Lord of the Rings, but at the same time rather than one after the other.[39] A learned Christian's heroic world[edit] Further information: Christianity in Middle-earth Another large theme, in both Beowulf and The Lord of the Rings, is that of the good pagan pre-Catholics such as Aragorn, who would on a strict interpretation of Christianity be damned as they had no knowledge of Christ.[40] Tolkien stated in a letter to his friend the Jesuit priest Robert Murray that he had cut religion out of the work because it "is absorbed into the story and the symbolism".[4] George Clark writes that Tolkien saw the Beowulf poet as[41] a learned Christian who re-created a heroic world and story in an implicitly Christian universe governed by a God whose existence and nature the poem's wiser characters intuit without the benefit of revelation. Tolkien's Beowulf poet was a version of himself, and his authorial persona in creating [The Lord of the Rings] was a version of that Beowulf poet."[41] Contrasted heroes[edit] Flieger contrasts the warrior-hero Aragorn with the suffering hero Frodo. Aragorn is, like Beowulf, an epic/romance hero, a bold leader and a healer-king. Frodo is "the little man of fairy tale", the little brother who unexpectedly turns out to be brave. But the fairy tale happy ending comes to Aragorn, marrying the beautiful princess (Arwen) and winning the kingdom (Gondor and Arnor); while Frodo gets "defeat and disillusionment—the stark, bitter ending typical of the Iliad, Beowulf, the Morte D'Arthur".[39] In other words, the two types of hero are not only contrasted, but combined, halves of their legends swapped over.[39] Flieger's analysis of heroes in Beowulf, fairy tales, and Lord of the Rings[39] Beowulf Fairy tale hero Aragorn Frodo Bold hero, victorious — Battle of Helm's Deep, Battle of the Pelennor Fields — — Small beginnings: Little man sets out on quest — Hobbit sets out not knowing where he's going Bitter ending — — Defeat and disillusionment after the quest — Happy ending: Returns home rich, marries princess King of Gondor and Arnor Marries Elf-princess Arwen — Notes[edit] ^ And his mother. ^ Nagy cites Bonjour, Adrien (1950).
