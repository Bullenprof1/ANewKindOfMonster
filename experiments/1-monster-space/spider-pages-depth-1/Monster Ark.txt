The scrolls are that of a much earlier Book of Genesis that claims that Noah had an ark before the famous Noah's Ark which was used to store the only surviving Nephilim. When they find this ark though, they have released it into the world, and the only way to stop it is to use Noah's Staff.[2] Cast[edit] Renee O'Connor as Dr. Ava Greenway Tim DeKay as Dr. Nicholas Zavaterro Tommy 'Tiny' Lister as Sergeant Major Gentry (as Tommy Lister Jr.) Amanda Crew as Joanna Carlos Leon as Belus Bill Parks as Russell Richard Gnolfo as Wilson Tommy Nohilly as Coles Vlado Mihailov as Martinez (as Vlado Mihaylov) Mike Straub as Hutch (as Michael Straub) Stefan Shterev as Insurgent #1 (as Stefan Shtereff) Bashar Rahal as Insurgent #2 (as Bashar Rahad) Hristo Mitzkov as Belus' Lieutenant (as Hristo Motzkov) George Zlatarev as Captain Backhar Velislav Pavlov as Laborer Dan Yarmolyuk as Mr. Fasanella Chris Thompson as Mr. Windheim Todd Jensen as Cain Atanas Srebrev as Noah References[edit] ^ http://www.film.com/tv/monster-ark/18788960 ^ http://tv.nytimes.com/show/189389/Monster-Ark/overview External links[edit] API at IMDb API at the TCM Movie Database v t e Films directed by Declan O'Brien Rock Monster (2008) Monster Ark (2008) Cyclops (2008) Wrong Turn 3: Left for Dead (2009) Sharktopus (2010) Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings (2011) Wrong Turn 5: Bloodlines (2012) Joy Ride 3: Roadkill (2014) v t e Films produced by Phillip J.
