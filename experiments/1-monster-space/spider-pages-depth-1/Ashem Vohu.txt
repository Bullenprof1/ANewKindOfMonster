The Ashem Vohu, after the Ahunavar is considered one of the basic, yet meaningful and powerful mantras in the religion. It is considered a lesson and praise of those who embrace Asha, along with being a sacred blessing for the aforementioned. It is also at the end of most of the prayers in the Khordeh Avesta, except a certain few, most notably the Fravarane.[1] Ashem vohu, Ahunavar, Yenghe hatam, and Airyaman ishya form four pillars of the Gathic canon, part of the group of Zoroastrian texts composed in the archaic dialect of the Avestan language.

For example: "Righteousness is best (of all that is) good. As desired, what is being desired is truth for him who (represents) best truth." or: “Asha is virtuously maginificent, And joy upon joy is what Asha provides For thus is Asha Vahishta." or: "Truth is best (of all that is) good. As desired, as desired, truth is for him who (represents) best truth."[2] or: "Holiness (Asha) is the best of all good: it is also happiness. Happy the man who is holy with perfect holiness!"[3] or: "Righteousness is the best good and it is happiness. Happiness is to her/him who is righteous for the sake of the best righteousness."[4] See also[edit] Zoroastrian prayer References[edit] ^ Boyce 2001, p. 38 harvnb error: no target: CITEREFBoyce2001 (help) ^ The Heritage of Zarathushtra - A new translation of His Gathas, Humbach & Ichaporia ^ "AVESTA: KHORDA AVESTA: Part 1". www.avesta.org.
