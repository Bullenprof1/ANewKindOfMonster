Beginning in 2003, her middle child Todd McCaffrey has written Pern novels, both solo and jointly with Anne. The series (as of July 2012) comprises 23 novels and several short stories. Most of the short fiction has been collected in two volumes or incorporated in one of the novels, so Dragonriders of Pern is sometimes identified with the 24 books.[b][1] Two of the novellas included in the first novel, Dragonflight, made McCaffrey the first woman to win a Hugo or Nebula Award.[2] Contents 1 Overview 2 Publications by the McCaffreys 2.1 Original trilogy 2.2 Harper Hall trilogy 2.3 Other fiction by Anne McCaffrey 2.4 Books by Todd McCaffrey or both 2.5 Books by Gigi McCaffrey 2.6 Books in progress 3 Awards 4 Other works 4.1 Gamebooks and companion books 4.2 Graphic novel 4.3 Music of Pern 4.4 Television and film adaptations 4.5 Games 5 Fandom 6 See also 7 Notes 8 References 9 External links Overview[edit] Map of the planet Pern Humans have colonized the planet Pern in the Rukbat star system, but have lost much of their technology and history (including their origin on Earth) due to periodic onslaughts of Thread, a mycorrhizoid spore that voraciously consumes all organic material, including humans and their crops, given the opportunity. Thread comes from the Red Star, actually another planet. The Red Star has a 250-Turn (Pernese year) elliptic orbit around Rukhbat, and when its orbit brings it close enough, Thread rains down on Pern at predictable intervals over about 50 Turns. The Pernese use intelligent firebreathing dragons to fight Thread. A human rider has a telepathic bond with their dragon, formed by Impression at the dragon's hatching. Later books deal with the initial colonization of Pern and the genetic modification of small native animals into creatures capable of carrying humans in flight. The Pernese live in a pre-industrial society, with lords, holds, harpers (musicians, entertainers, and teachers), and dragons, with occasional examples of higher technology (like flamethrowers, the telegraph, chemical fertilizers, and powerful microscopes and telescopes). There are four basic social classes: Weyrfolk (including Dragonriders) who live in Weyrs, Holders who rule Holds (cities, towns and farms), crafters, and the Holdless who have no permanent home (including traders, displaced Holders, and brigands). The series as a whole covers over two and a half millennia.[citation needed] Publications by the McCaffreys[edit] This list is arranged in publication order. For Pern historical order see the chronological List of Pern books. There are 25 Dragonriders of Pern novels and two collections of short stories as of 2018. Anne McCaffrey once requested reading the works in the order they were written.[3] That differs greatly from Pern historical order, for several reasons. The McCaffreys have published stories set in several different periods of Pern's history from initial exploration to more than 2,500 years after landing (AL). Multiple stories feature the same events from different viewpoints. Some stories feature travel between times, even across centuries. Todd McCaffrey, writing alone or with his mother, has specialized in an early time period. Original trilogy[edit] These stories take place immediately before and during the Ninth Pass, about 2,500 years after landing (AL). Dragonflight 1968, by Anne McCaffrey (1968; Composed primarily of McCaffrey's first two Pern novellas, Weyr Search and Dragonrider, which were originally published in Analog science fiction magazine, in the October 1967 and December 1967 issues respectively.)

The White Dragon 1978, by Anne McCaffrey (1978; although published prior to Dragondrums, The White Dragon continues the adventures of certain Dragondrums characters; McCaffrey recommended reading Dragonsong, Dragonsinger and Dragondrums before The White Dragon; The White Dragon incorporates McCaffrey's story "A Time When") The trilogy was released 1978 in omnibus edition titled The Dragonriders of Pern by Nelson Doubleday Science Fiction Book Club.[4] Harper Hall trilogy[edit] These stories take place immediately prior to and concurrently with those depicted in Dragonquest and The White Dragon.

Graphic novel[edit] In 1991 Dragonflight, the first Pern book published, was released as a set of three graphic novels by Eclipse Books of Forestville, California. The story was adapted across all three graphic novels by Brynne Stephens. The first two graphic novels were illustrated by Lela Dowling and Fred Von Tobel, the third by Lela Dowling and Cynthia Martin.[7] Music of Pern[edit] This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (December 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) There are two CDs of music relating to the Teaching Ballads and the works of Masterharper Robinton and Menolly. "The Masterharper of Pern" was made in 1998 by Anglo-Alaskan duo Tania Opland and Mike Freeman in collaboration with Anne McCaffrey at her request, and features the music of Robinton. The project began as an idea to include written music in the book of the same name, printed on the inner faces of the cover. By the time the composers had written and auditioned the early drafts at the author's table it was clear that making the songs a reality to their creator's satisfaction was finally possible. The CD project was completed some eighteen months later (1998) and released to the approval of the author and fans of the series worldwide.[8] The second CD pertaining mainly to the work another Pernese harper, Menolly, was completed in December 2008.[9] Entitled "Sunset's Gold," this features Opland and Freeman with other musicians, and comprises twelve tracks of music recorded from 2006 to 2008. The CD includes the ballad "Four Hundred Turns" written by Anne McCaffrey shortly after she completed "Dragonflight." It was placed in a desk drawer where it lay forgotten for almost forty years until the author rediscovered it just as the CD project was underway. It had never been seen or published before. Songbooks are also available containing the music from the first CD, with a similar book for the second in the works.[10] Television and film adaptations[edit] Prior to 1995, the motion picture and ancillary rights to the literary property were optioned by various entities, including Robert Mandell (for a cartoon series adaptation that was eventually redeveloped into Princess Gwenevere and the Jewel Riders[11]) and Kerry Skogland. In 1996, McCaffrey sold the motion picture rights to an Irish company, Zyntopo Teoranta, who entered into a co-production agreement with Alliance Atlantis, covering development including advanced 3-D animation and compositing effects for television budgets. Distribution pre-sale efforts failed, and Zyntopo Teoranta entered into an agreement with Ronald D. Moore as showrunner to present the project to Warner Brothers Network. In 2002, Warner Brothers Network and writer Ronald D. Moore had completed sets and casting for a pilot episode, and were within a few days of filming. Moore had sent the pilot episode to Warners for final approval. It was returned with so many changes to the basic structure of Pern – making it more like Buffy: The Vampire Slayer and Xena: Warrior Princess – that it no longer much resembled the world created by Anne McCaffrey. As a fan of the Dragonriders of Pern series, Moore refused to continue. Filming was canceled, and rights ownership remained with Zyntopo Teoranta's assign, Kua Media Corporation (Canada).[12] In May 2006, it was announced that rights to the entire Dragonriders of Pern series were optioned by Oscar-winning production company Copperheart Entertainment.[13] Copperheart announced their intention to bring Pern to the big screen. On 12 April 2011, Copperheart announced signing David Hayter as screenwriter and Don Murphy as executive producer for a film version of Dragonflight, with production expected to begin in 2012.[14][15] On 29 July 2014, Warner Bros. optioned all 22 volumes of the series for a feature live-action film.[16] On 11 November 2014, Warner Bros. announced the hire of author-screenwriter Sarah Cornwell to adapt the first installment of the series.[17] Games[edit] There have been several games released based on the Pern series. In 1983 Mayfair Games created a board game Dragonriders of Pern featuring cards with Pern characters and locations. This game is now rare and valuable to Pern collectors. In 1984, Gallimard published Dragonriders of Pern: The Book Game, a game in which 2 players use illustrated books to resolve aerial engagement against the "threads". In 1983, Epyx released the video game Dragonriders of Pern for the Atari 800 and Commodore 64 in which the player could battle Thread and engage in diplomacy on Pern. In 2001, a video game Dragonriders: Chronicles of Pern was created by Ubisoft for the PC and Dreamcast under license from zyntopo teoranta, the Irish corporation which owns the motion picture, gaming and ancillary rights. This game follows a dragonrider as he Searches for young women to be candidates for Impressing a new gold dragon, and battles the "bad guys" on an adventure across Pern. A number of online MUD-style games have been created exploring the Pern universe, most notably PernMUSH. These are unofficial and tend to centre on role-playing rather than combat. Fandom[edit] Pern fandom consists of a large variety of fan communities. The largest part of fandom is made up by clubs that allow their members to 'play' Pern by creating original characters within the setting of Anne McCaffrey's world. To avoid conflicts with Pern canon and trademarks, each club typically chooses a particular location and timeline as a unique setting different from Anne McCaffrey's established history of Pern. Most commonly, clubs are named for the main Weyr chosen as playing location. Historically, the first clubs started out publishing printed fanzines containing fanfiction and artwork. With the advent of the internet, clubs using online technology such as roleplay via chat or email (PBeM) became popular. Text-based online virtual reality games, primarily MUSH and MUCK variants such as PernMUSH, have modeled Pern since the early 1990s. In the mid '90s, stringent rules were placed on the creation of new clubs and the governance of existing clubs, resulting in legal action against some fans.[18] For example, no new fan-created MU* games were allowed while the game rights were licensed to Ubisoft for the development of the Dragon Riders: Chronicles of Pern computer game (released in 2001). In November 2004, Anne McCaffrey relaxed her fandom rules significantly and allowed Pernese fanfiction to be posted freely throughout the Internet. Soon after, fanfiction sites such as FanFiction.net started offering the opportunity to post and read fanfiction based on Anne McCaffrey's works. The relaxing of the rules also resulted in the appearance of message board-based games as another popular club type. Fan sites no longer require approval and are not bound to the formerly strict canon rules, resulting in fan clubs testing out alternatives such as new dragon colors or off-Pern scenarios. From 2000 until 2005, Anne McCaffrey's website offered a popular discussion forum and chat (The Kitchen Table) for fans to interact with each other and with the author. After its discontinuation in January 2005, several fan-organized discussion forums have taken its place as an outlet for fan activity. Offline, the largest Pern fan gathering is WeyrFest, held yearly at Dragon*Con since 1992. Over the last few years, Anne McCaffrey and Todd McCaffrey were frequent attendees at WeyrFest, offering fans a chance to meet the authors in person. Anne was originally scheduled to attend the 2011 Dragon*Con, but had deferred her appearance until the 2012 event due to heart problems, just a few months ahead of her death in late November.
