His father was a farmer and college professor. In junior high school, Cook played wargames such as Avalon Hill's Blitzkrieg and Afrika Korps: "I was primarily a wargamer, but there wasn't any role-playing available then".[1] In college, he was introduced to the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game through the University of Iowa gaming club.[1] Cook earned his B.A. in English (with a Theater minor) in 1977.[1] He married his high school sweetheart, Helen, with whom he had one son, Ian.[1] Cook became a high school teacher in Milligan, Nebraska, where his students gave him his nickname of "Zeb." The name derives from his signature, which is dominated by a stroke resembling a 'Z,' as well as from his resemblance to the James Arness character Zeb Macahan in the TV series How the West Was Won.[1] Career[edit] Cook responded to an ad in Dragon magazine for a game designer position at TSR. After writing a sample module section and completing the designer test that the company then used, Cook became the third full-time game designer hired by TSR.[1] Lawrence Schick was head of design and development at the time and brought Cook on board during a time of substantial growth at TSR.[2]:11 Cook later became Senior Designer. "Game designing is hard work [...] but everything worth doing is hard work. The important thing is to do it well, and to have fun while you're doing it." Cook created role-playing games, modules, family board games, card games, rulebooks, and party mystery games.[1] He created the Partyzone mystery game line and The Spy Ring scenario.[1] The first Partyzone game was named one of the Top 100 Games of 1985 by Games Magazine. Other notable works for TSR include the role-playing games Conan the Barbarian, Crimefighters,[3] The Adventures of Indiana Jones, Star Frontiers, Sirocco, and Escape from New York. Cook also wrote several influential early adventure modules for D&D and AD&D, such as A1: Slave Pits of the Undercity, I1: Dwellers of the Forbidden City, X1: The Isle of Dread, X4: Master of the Desert Nomads, and X5: Temple of Death (the 'Desert Nomads' series). Other module work included CM4: Earthshaker!, AC5: Dragon Tiles II, AC2: D&D Game Combat Shield, B6: The Veiled Society, CB1: Conan Unchained!, and M1: Blizzard Pass for D&D and AD&D, and Top Secret module TS005: Orient Express and Boot Hill module BH2: Lost Conquistador Mine.[1] After Tom Moldvay wrote the second edition of the D&D Basic Set, published in 1980, Cook developed the Expert Set to take characters beyond third level.[2]:11 Cook was the primary author of the original Oriental Adventures,[2]:17 ostensibly under the guidance and direction of Gary Gygax,[1] which among other things introduced the concept of non-weapon proficiencies into AD&D,[4] and he designed the far eastern setting, Kara-Tur.[5] Cook, with Jim Ward, Steve Winter, and Mike Breault, co-wrote the adventure scenario that was adapted into the game Pool of Radiance.[6] Cook was the lead designer on the 2nd edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game.[2]:22[7] In Dragon #118 (February 1987), Cook wrote a column titled "Who Dies?" in which he discussed which character classes may be thrown out in the revision, with the intention of provoking a response from readers.[2]:22 Cook was also the lead designer on the Planescape campaign setting.[7] When TSR was looking to replace Spelljammer after the setting ended, Slade Henson suggested a new campaign setting could be built on the first-edition Manual of the Planes; after the idea sat dormant for a year, Cook picked it up and invented Planescape as a result.[2]:26 One reviewer described Planescape as "the finest game world ever produced for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons".[8] Cook left TSR in 1994 to work in the field of electronic media.[citation needed] He worked on the game Fallout 2.[9] He was the lead designer on the 2005 City of Villains computer game for Cryptic Studios.[2]:153[7] After he left Cryptic, he joined Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment as the lead systems designer for the video game Stargate Worlds.[10] In 2001 he was inducted into the Origins Hall of Fame.[11] As of 2013, Cook works as Content Designer at ZeniMax Online Studios on The Elder Scrolls Online.[12] See also[edit] Amazing Engine Crimefighters Dwellers of the Forbidden City List of Dungeons & Dragons modules Scourge of the Slave Lords References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l "TSR Profiles".
