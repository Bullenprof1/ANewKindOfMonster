This article contains incomplete lists that may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by expanding them with entries that are reliably sourced. Concept-art done for Sintel, 3rd open-movie of the Blender Foundation. Artwork : David Revoy. This is a list of dragons in film and television. The dragons are organized by either film or television and further by whether the media is animation or live-action. They are sorted alphabetically by name or if there is none, by the name of the media. Further information is the title of the media, the type of dragon, whether it transforms to/from something else, the voice actor if it has one and additional notes. In the type of dragon there may be an indicator with a number followed by "H" this means the dragon has multiple heads.
