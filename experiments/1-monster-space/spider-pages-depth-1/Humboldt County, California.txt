As of the 2010 census, the population was 132,646.[4] The county seat is Eureka.[5] Humboldt County comprises the Eureka–Arcata–Fortuna, California Micropolitan Statistical Area. It is located on the far North Coast, about 270 miles (435 km) north of San Francisco. Its primary population centers of Eureka, the site of College of the Redwoods main campus, and the smaller college town of Arcata, site of Humboldt State University, are located adjacent to Humboldt Bay, California's second largest natural bay.[6] Area cities and towns are known for hundreds of ornate examples of Victorian architecture. Humboldt County is a densely forested mountainous and rural county with about 110 miles (177 km) of coastline (more than any other county in the state),[7] situated along the Pacific coast in Northern California's rugged Coast (Mountain) Ranges. With nearly 1,500,000 acres (6,100 km2) of combined public and private forest in production, Humboldt County alone produces twenty percent of total volume and thirty percent of the total value of all forest products produced in California.[8] The county contains over forty percent of all remaining old growth Coast Redwood forests,[9] the vast majority of which is protected or strictly conserved within dozens of national, state, and local forests and parks, totaling approximately 680,000 acres (1,060 sq mi).[10] Contents 1 History 2 Geography 2.1 Rivers 2.2 Seismic activity 2.3 Climate 3 Demographics 3.1 2000 3.2 2010 3.3 2011 3.3.1 Places by population, race, and income 3.4 Lead (2017-18) 4 Economy 4.1 Locally based companies 4.2 Dairy 4.3 Cannabis 5 Parks and recreation 5.1 National protected areas 5.2 State protected areas 5.3 County parks 6 Arts and culture 7 Government 7.1 Voter registration 7.1.1 Cities by population and voter registration 7.2 Overview 8 Crime 8.1 Cities by population and crime rates 9 Education 10 Media 10.1 Print 10.2 Television 10.3 Local internet media 10.4 Radio 10.4.1 For-profit 10.4.2 Non-profit 10.5 Community media 11 Transportation 11.1 Major highways 11.2 Public transportation 11.3 Airports 11.4 Seaport 12 Events 13 In popular culture 13.1 Movies 13.2 TV Shows 13.3 Books 14 Communities 14.1 Cities 14.2 Census-designated places 14.3 Other unincorporated communities 14.4 Indian reservations 14.5 Population ranking 15 Notable people 16 See also 17 Notes 18 References 19 Further reading 20 External links History[edit] The original inhabitants of the area now known as Humboldt County include the Wiyot, Yurok, Hupa, Karuk, Chilula, Whilkut, Tsnungwe and the Eel River Athapaskan peoples, including the Wailaki, Mattole and Nongatl.[11] Spanish traders made unintended visits to California with the Manila Galleons on their return trips from the Philippines beginning in 1565. Humboldt County was formed in 1853 from parts of Trinity County. The first recorded entry by people of European origin was a landing by the Spanish in 1775 in Trinidad.[11] The first recorded entry of Humboldt Bay by non-natives was an 1806 visit from a sea otter hunting party from Sitka employed by the Russian American Company.[11] The hunting party included Captain Jonathan Winship, an American, and some Aleut hunters.[11][12] The bay was not visited again by people of European origin until 1849 when Josiah Gregg's party visited.[12] In 1850, Douglas Ottinger and Hans Buhne entered the bay, naming it Humboldt in honor of the great naturalist and world explorer, Alexander von Humboldt, and the name was later applied to the county as a whole.[13] The area around Humboldt Bay was once solely inhabited by the Wiyot Indian tribe. One of the largest Wiyot villages, Tolowot, was located on Indian Island in Humboldt Bay. Founded around 900 BC, it contains a shell midden 6 acres (2.4 ha) in size and 14 feet (4.3 m) deep. It was the site of the February 26, 1860 massacre of the Wiyot people that was recorded by Bret Harte, then living in Union, now called Arcata. Between 60 and 200 Wiyot men, women, and children were murdered that night in the midst of religious ceremony. Tolowot is now a restricted site and a National Historic Landmark.[12] In 2019, the island was restored to the Wiyot tribe, and is now known as Tuluwat or Duluwat island. State historic landmarks in Humboldt County include Arcata and Mad River Railroad, California's First Drilled Oil Wells in Petrolia, Camp Curtis, Centerville Beach Cross, the city of Eureka, the town of Ferndale, Fort Humboldt, Humboldt Harbor Historical District, the Jacoby Building, The Old Arrow Tree, Old Indian Village of Tsurai, the Town of Trinidad, and Trinidad Head.[12] On February 5 and 6, 1885, Eureka's entire Chinese population of 300 men and 20 women were expelled after a gunfight between rival Chinese gangs (tongs) resulted in the wounding of a 12-year-old boy and the death of 56-year-old David Kendall, a Eureka City Councilman. After the shooting, an angry mob of 600 Eureka residents met and informed the Chinese that they were no longer wanted in Eureka and would be hanged if they were to stay in town longer than 3 p.m. the next day. They were put on two steamships and shipped to San Francisco. No one was killed in the expulsion. Another Chinese expulsion occurred during 1906 in a cannery on the Eel River, in which 23 Chinese cannery workers were expelled after objections to their presence. However, some Chinese remained in the Orleans area, where some white landowners sheltered and purchased food for the Chinese mineworkers until after racial tension passed. Chinese did not return to the coastal cities until the 1950s.[14] Geography[edit] According to the United States Census Bureau, Humboldt County encompasses 4,052 square miles, 3,568 square miles of which is land and 484 square miles is water.[15] Cape Mendocino is the westernmost point in California (longitude 124 degrees, 24 minutes, 30 seconds). Humboldt Bay, the only deep water port between San Francisco and Coos Bay, Oregon, is located on the coast at the midpoint of the county. Humboldt County contains a diversity of plant and animal species, with significant forest and coastal habitats. In coastal areas there are extensive amounts of redwood forests.[16] A prominent understory shrub is the toyon, whose northern range limit is in Humboldt County.[17] Rivers[edit] Mouth of Humboldt County's Little River on the Pacific Coast. Rockefeller Forest, the largest remaining old growth Redwood forest on earth, is located within Humboldt Redwoods State Park. Humboldt County's major rivers include (in order of flow-cubic meters per second-from largest to smallest): Klamath River Eel River Trinity River Mad River The smaller rivers include Redwood Creek, significant due to amount of its flow; the Van Duzen; the Eel River syncline group composed of the South Fork, the North Fork, and the Salt River; the Mattole, Salmon, Elk, Bear, and Little rivers. Seismic activity[edit] Historically, Humboldt County and the entire far north coast have had many earthquakes over 6.0 magnitude. The 1992 Cape Mendocino earthquakes were a series of three major earthquakes that occurred off the coast of Cape Mendocino, California on April 25 and 26, 1992, the largest being a 7.2. Ninety-five people were injured and property in the county sustained considerable damage.[18] In 2010 a 6.5 magnitude earthquake struck offshore, 33 mi (53 km) west of Eureka, resulting in only minor injuries and some structural damage to houses and utilities, and no fatalities reported.[19] The town of Arcata is built on top of an accretionary wedge. This was formed by the subduction of the Gorda plate underneath the North American plate.[20] Climate[edit] The coastal zone of the county experiences very wet, cool winters and dry, mild foggy summers. In the winter, temperatures range from highs of 40–59 °F (4–15 °C) to lows of 32–49 °F (0–9 °C). Coastal summers are cool to mild, with average highs of 60–69 °F (16–21 °C) and frequent fogs. Coastal summer temperatures range from highs of 64–70 °F (18–21 °C) to lows of 46–55 °F (8–13 °C). In the populated areas and cities near the coast, the highest temperatures tend to occur at locations just a few miles inland from Eureka and Arcata, in towns like Fortuna, Rio Dell, and smaller unincorporated communities located somewhat further away from Humboldt Bay. In these locations summer highs are 70–75 °F (21–24 °C). The coastal zone experiences a number of frosty nights in winter and early spring, though snowfall and hard freezes are rare. Coastal winters are cool and wet. Winter rainstorms are frequent, with averages from 30 inches (760 mm) to 100 inches (2,500 mm) a year varying with elevation. Inland areas of the county also experience wet, cool winters. Snowfall is common at elevations over 3,000 ft (910 m) throughout the winter months, and is even deep enough at higher elevations to have inspired the opening (now defunct) of a small ski lift operation on Horse Mountain, near Willow Creek, for several decades in the late 1900s. Summer displays the sharpest difference between the coastal and inland climates. Inland regions of Humboldt County experience highs of 80–99 °F (27–37 °C) depending on the elevation and distance from the ocean. Occasional summer highs of 100 °F (38 °C) are common in eastern and southern parts of the county including Orleans, Hoopa, Willow Creek, Garberville, Honeydew, and inland river valleys.

(2017-18)[edit] Humboldt County children are at greater risk of dangerously elevated blood lead levels than Flint, Michigan's - and almost double that of any other California county measured. The cases are concentrated in Eureka's Old Town and downtown areas.[36][37][38] Economy[edit] Humboldt County is known for its impressive redwood trees, and many acres of private redwood timberland make Humboldt the top timber producer in California. The lush river bottoms adjacent to the ocean are for producing rich, high-quality dairy products. Somewhat more inland the warmer valleys have historically produced abundant apples and other fruit. More recently vineyards have been planted in the Trinity, Klamath, Mattole and upper Eel river.

The Humboldt Creamery, a significant producer of high grade ice cream and other dairy products, still operates from the original headquarters located at Fernbridge adjacent to the Eel River.[39] Cannabis[edit] Further information: Cannabis in California As part of the Emerald Triangle, Humboldt County is known for its cultivation of Cannabis, estimated to be worth billions of dollars.[40][41] Proposition 215 allows patients and caregivers who are given a doctor's recommendation to legally (State level only) grow up to 99 plants in Humboldt County.[42][43] However, in the years before Prop 215 (early 1970s – late 1980s), Humboldt County saw a large migration of the Bay Area counter-culture to the region. Many came looking to purchase cheap land, and ended-up growing marijuana to pay for their land. Especially around Garberville and Redway, the rural culture and hippie scene eventually collaborated to create a rural hippie community in which marijuana became the center of the economy and the culture. Many people prospered by producing marijuana for California and other states because of its reputation for quality.[44] A Redway radio station, KMUD, in the past has issued warnings and alerts to the region with information on whereabouts of law enforcement on their way to raid marijuana gardens.[45][44] The Campaign Against Marijuana Planting is the multi-agency law enforcement task force managed by the California Department of Justice, formed with the prime purpose of eradicating illegal cannabis production in California. The operations began in the late 70s, but the name CAMP became used after its official establishment in 1983. While the influence of CAMP in Humboldt County has waned with decriminalization of marijuana, there is a renewed interest at the state level regarding valid growing permits and environmental concerns. As a result, CAMP is today still utilized as a policing body, in accordance with the DEA.[46] Yearly CAMP reports, published by the California Department of Justice, Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement (BNE) are available online through Humboldt State University's Special Collections. Starting in 1983, the annual reports detail the organizational structure and names of individual participants, a summary of the season's activities, tactics, and mention of special successes, trends and hazards.[46] County officials and the industry have encountered challenges in the transition from an illegal, underground economy to legal recreational cannabis sales that began in California in 2018.[47] Parks and recreation[edit] National protected areas[edit] National Park Redwood National and State Parks – National Park Service Conservation area King Range National Conservation Area and The Lost Coast – Bureau of Land Management Recreation area Samoa Dunes Recreation Area – Bureau of Land Management Forests Headwaters Forest Reserve – Bureau of Land Management Six Rivers National Forest – U.S. Forest Service Trinity National Forest – U.S. Forest Service Wildlife refuge Humboldt Bay National Wildlife Refuge – Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service State protected areas[edit] Beaches Little River State Beach Trinidad State Beach Parks Fort Humboldt State Historic Park Grizzly Creek Redwoods State Park Humboldt Lagoons State Park Humboldt Redwoods State Park Patrick's Point State Park Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park Richardson Grove State Park Sinkyone Wilderness State Park Tide pools Patrick's Point State Park Moonstone Beach Indian Beach (also known as Old Home Beach) Recreation areas Benbow Lake State Recreation Area Harry A.

The Morris Graves Museum of Art conserves and displays the works of local artists in a restored Carnegie Library building. The Ferndale Repertory Theatre is the county's oldest theater company; it has been in operation since 1972 at the Hart Theater building in Ferndale.[61] The Humboldt Crabs, founded in 1945, are the oldest continuously-operated summer collegiate, wood-bat baseball team in the country.[62] See also the List of museums in the North Coast (California). Government[edit] Humboldt County is in California's 2nd congressional district, represented by Democrat Jared Huffman.[63] In the state legislature, Humboldt is part of the 2nd Senate District, represented by Democrat Mike McGuire,[64] and the 2nd Assembly District, represented by Democrat Jim Wood.[65] Election audits in the county since 2008 have used a distinctive system which has not spread elsewhere. They scan all ballots and release a file of the images with a digital signature, so candidates and the public can recount by hand or electronically to find if the official totals are correct. The first time they did this they found the official software omitted 200 ballots.[66][67][68][69] Voter registration[edit] Population and registered voters Total population[28] 133,585   Registered voters[70][note 3] 79,708 59.7%     Democratic[70] 33,155 41.6%     Republican[70] 20,238 25.4%     Democratic–Republican spread[70] +12,917 +16.2%     Independent[70] 2,557 3.2%     Green[70] 3,036 3.8%     Libertarian[70] 801 1.0%     Peace and Freedom[70] 342 0.4%     Other[70] 222 0.3%     No party preference[70] 19,357 24.3% Cities by population and voter registration[edit] Cities by population and voter registration City Population[28] Registered voters[70] [note 3] Democratic[70] Republican[70] D–R spread[70] Other[70] No party preference[70] Arcata 17,118 71.9% 45.1% 10.2% +34.9% 15.5% 32.2% Blue Lake 1,336 61.4% 43.0% 20.4% +22.6% 13.7% 26.1% Eureka 27,027 53.6% 42.5% 25.3% +17.2% 11.3% 24.1% Ferndale 1,503 63.7% 39.4% 38.2% +1.2% 7.5% 17.4% Fortuna 11,753 54.6% 33.7% 38.1% -4.4% 10.0% 22.0% Rio Dell 3,342 50.9% 33.5% 35.3% -1.8% 13.3% 23.1% Trinidad 286 94.8% 52.8% 18.1% +34.7% 9.2% 22.5% Overview[edit] From 1920 to 1984, the county voted for the national winner of each Presidential election held within these years. Since 1988, Humboldt has been a Democratic county in Presidential and congressional elections. The last Republican presidential candidate to win a majority in the county was Ronald Reagan, a Californian, in 1984.[71] In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Humboldt also had a substantial number of people affiliated with the Green Party, but that number has declined in recent years; however, the Green Party has had its best performance by presidential and gubernatorial candidates of any county in the United States in Humboldt County, with Jill Stein gaining her largest county-level number of votes in Humboldt in 2016.

HTA also offers service between McKinleyville or Arcata and Willow Creek and an express bus between Arcata and College of the Redwoods when classes are in session. Eureka Transit Service, operated in the City of Eureka, provides local service on four scheduled routes (one hour headway) in Eureka and its adjacent unincorporated communities. Connections can be made to the Redwood Transit System at several places in Eureka. Arcata and Mad River Transit System, operated by the City of Arcata with funding from Humboldt State University. A&MRTS provides fixed route local bus service on two scheduled routes (one hour headway) in Arcata and an additional route between the Valley West Neighborhood and the university when classes are in session. The city of Blue Lake and the Blue Lake Rancheria operates the Blue Lake Rancheria Transit Authority.[115] This provides fixed route intercity transit bus service (one hour headway) between Arcata and the Blue Lake Rancheria Indian Reservation and casino and local service within the city of Blue Lake. Del Norte County's Redwood Coast Transit operates fixed route intercity transit bus service between Arcata and Crescent City or Smith River. Amtrak Thruway bus has stops in many towns in the region, including Eureka, Arcata, and Fortuna. These stops are not managed by Amtrak and therefore have no services beyond serving passengers. Full service is only provided at the train station in Martinez, near San Francisco. Airports[edit] Arcata-Eureka Airport is located in McKinleyville (north of Arcata). Commercial flights are available. Other general aviation airports are located at Dinsmore, Garberville, Kneeland, Murray Field (Eureka), Samoa Field and Rohnerville (Fortuna).

The infamous Patterson-Gimlin film was filmed on Bluff Creek near Orleans, California. Humboldt County has also been the subject of multiple documentary miniseries including Discovery Channel's Pot Cops and Netflix's Murder Mountain. Humboldt County has also been featured in episodes of On the Case with Paula Zahn, The Profit, Hamilton's Pharmacopeia, Top Gear, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Survivorman, Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, Finding Bigfoot, Treehouse Masters, Rescue 911, Walking With Dinosaurs, Somebody's Gotta Do It, Monsters Resurrected, Weediquette, Dan Rather Reports, Monster Fish, Beachfront Bargain Hunt, and many more.[154] Humboldt County has also been the filming location for countless national television advertisements, including many major car commercials.[154] Books[edit] In the book Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov there is a possible pun using the county's name (Humboldt) in connection to the main character's name (Humbert Humbert). This appears on page 108: "With the help of a guidebook I located [The Enchanted Hunters inn] in the secluded town of Briceland." This 'secluded town' could very well be a reference to the unincorporated Briceland of Humboldt County, making The Enchanted Hunters in 'Humboldt Land', continuing the novel's grotesque fairy-tale veneer.[155] Communities[edit] The Carson Mansion of Eureka Cities[edit] Arcata Blue Lake Eureka (county seat) Ferndale Fortuna Rio Dell Trinidad Census-designated places[edit] Alderpoint Bayview Benbow Big Lagoon Cutten Fairhaven Fieldbrook Fields Landing Garberville Hoopa Humboldt Hill Hydesville Indianola Loleta McKinleyville Manila Miranda Myers Flat Myrtletown Orick Phillipsville Pine Hills Redcrest Redway Samoa Scotia Shelter Cove Weott Westhaven-Moonstone Willow Creek Other unincorporated communities[edit] Alton Bayside Blocksburg Briceland Bridgeville Carlotta Cooks Valley Dinsmore Dyerville Elk River Englewood Fernbridge Fort Seward Freshwater Freshwater Corners Fruitland Glendale Holmes Honeydew Johnsons King Salmon Kneeland Korbel Maple Creek Moonstone Orleans Patricks Point Pepperwood Petrolia Pine Hill Port Kenyon Ridgewood Heights Riverside Park Rohnerville Rosewood Shively Stafford Sunny Brae Weitchpec Westhaven Whitethorn Indian reservations[edit] Humboldt County has eight Indian reservations lying within its borders.
