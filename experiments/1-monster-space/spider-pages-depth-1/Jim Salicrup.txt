He is credited with coming up with the idea of running "Kraven's Last Hunt" as a crossover through all the Spider-Man titles.[8] He followed this by hiring Todd McFarlane to draw the title. The popularity of McFarlane's work led to the launch of another Spider-Man title, Spider-Man, which Salicrup edited as well.[9] Salicrup was the editor of Marvel Age magazine for eight years. He wrote Transformers, Sledge Hammer!, The A-Team, The Amazing Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk toilet paper,[10][11] In 1992, Salicrup became the editor-in-chief of Topps Comics, where he edited Bram Stoker's Dracula, X-Files, The Lone Ranger and Tonto, Zorro, Lady Rawhide, a line of Jack Kirby superhero titles, Ray Bradbury Comics, and more.
