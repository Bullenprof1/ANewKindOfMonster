Torres, and sponsored by Comic Book Resources and its participating advertisers.[7] Inspired by the singing contest American Idol, CBI is a five-week and five-round competition in which each contestant is given one week to draw a script provided by guest judges. These invited comic-book professionals comment on the artists' work in each round. The contestants to move on to subsequent rounds are selected by fans who vote in a weekly poll.[7] Patrick Scherberger won CBI1 and has since worked on a number of Marvel Comics titles like Marvel Adventures: Spider-Man, Marvel Adventures: Hulk and GeNext.[8][9] Jonathan Hickman was the runner-up in CBI1 and went on to work for Virgin Comics (Guy Ritchie's Gamekeeper and Seven Brothers), Image Comics (Pax Romana, A Red Mass for Mars and Transhuman) and Marvel Comics (Fantastic Four, Astonishing Tales).[10][11] Carlos Rodríguez won CBI2 and went on to work on Shadowhawk for Image and Batman and the Outsiders for DC Comics.[12][13] Billy Penn also competed in CBI2 and went on to work on Savage Dragon.[13][14] Joe Infurnari, another CBI2 contestant, went on a couple of titles from Oni Press, including Wasteland and Borrowed Time, as well as on the back-up feature of Jersey Gods with Mark Waid.[13][15] Dan McDaid, writer and artist on various Doctor Who comics for Panini and IDW and Jersey Gods for Image Comics, as well as strips for DC Comics, competed in CBI3.[16] Nick Pitarra competed in CBI3 and went on to do work for Marvel Comics on books such as Astonishing Tales.[17] Charles Paul Wilson III, artist on The Stuff of Legend, competed in CBI3.[18] Reception[edit] In 2008, the University at Buffalo's research library described Comic Book Resources as "the premiere comics-related site on the Web."[19] In April 2013, comics writer Mark Millar said he read the site every morning after reading the Financial Times.[20] Awards[edit] 1999: Won the "Favourite Comics-Related Website (professional)" Eagle Award.[1] 2000: Won the "Favourite Comics-Related Website (professional)" Eagle Award.[1] 2001: Won the "Favourite Comics-Related Website (professional)" Eagle Award.[21] 2004: Nominated for the "Favourite Comics-Related Website" Eagle Award.[1] 2005: Nominated for the "Favourite Comics-Related Website" Eagle Award.[1] 2006: Nominated for the "Favourite Comics-Related Website" Eagle Award.[1] 2007: Nominated for the "Favourite Comics Related Website" Eagle Award.[1] 2008: Nominated for the "Favourite Comics-Related Website" Eagle Award.[22] 2009: Won the "Best Comics-Related Periodical/Journalism" Eisner Award.[23] 2010: Won the "Favourite Comics-Related Website" Eagle Award.[24] 2011: Won the "Favourite Comics-Related Website" Eagle Award.[25] 2011: Won the "Best Comics-Related Periodical/Journalism" Eisner Award.[26] 2013: Won the "Best Biographical, Historical or Journalistic Presentation" Harvey Award for its Robot 6 blog.[27] 2014: Won the "Best Comics-Related Periodical/Journalism" Eisner Award.[28] Controversy[edit] In 2014, an article by guest author Janelle Asselin criticized the cover of DC Comics's Teen Titans,[29] leading to harassment of and personal threats against Asselin in the website's community forums.
