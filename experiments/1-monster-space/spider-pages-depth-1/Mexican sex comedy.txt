It is recognized as a collection of usually low quality films with low budgets. Although the films had sexual tones and used double entendre, they were not particularly explicit (it was common for the male characters in this films to comedically fail in their attempts to have sex the female characters, and when intercourse did happen the performances where exagerated and pantomime-like, aiming to generate laughter more than arousal). The genre is possibly based on the Italian erotic comedies.[1] The popular term for it came from the film Las ficheras, produced and released in 1975, which described the experiences of many women who entertained men at nightclubs. The settings and plots of these films tended to be simple, usually dealing with the sexual scapades of working-class Mexicans; the male leads often being bricklayers, truck drivers and unemployed petty scammers, while the female leads often were nightclub dancers, waitresses or prostitutes in small brothels (althrought unfaitful wives and women with a busy sex life outside their job could occationaly be major characters). Though they enjoyed box-office success and were popular, they are now generally regarded as poor examples of Mexican cinema by film critics and scholars on the contemporary Mexican culture industry[citation needed]; moreover, they frequently received classification as being unsuitable for minors. Some of the films of this Mexican genre included El rey de las ficheras, La pulquería, Muñecas de medianoche, Bellas de noche, and Entre ficheras anda el diablo. The best-known Mexican and international actors and actresses who were known to have participated in ficheras films were: Sasha Montenegro Angélica Chaín Andrés García Mauricio Garcés Lina Santos Lyn May Marcia Bell Leticia Perdigón Carmen Salinas Alfonso Zayas Jorge Rivero Alberto Rojas "El caballo" Rafael Inclán Roberto Ibañez Leopoldo García Peláez Benítez "Polo Polo" Antonio Raxel Raúl Padilla "El Choforo" Miguel M.
