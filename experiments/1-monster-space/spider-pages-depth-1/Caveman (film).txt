After being banished along with his friend Lar (Dennis Quaid), Atouk falls in with a band of assorted misfits, among them the comely Tala (Shelley Long) and the elderly blind man Gog (Jack Gilford). The group has ongoing encounters with hungry dinosaurs, and rescues Lar from a "nearby ice age", where they encounter an abominable snowman. In the course of these adventures they discover sedative drugs, fire, invent cooking, music, weapons, and learn how to walk fully upright. Atouk uses these advancements to lead an attack on Tonda, overthrowing him and becoming the tribe's new leader. He rejects Lana and takes Tala as his mate, and they live happily ever after.

The river and fishing lake scene was shot in the Mexican state of Durango, and some scenes were filmed at the Churubusco Studios in Mexico City. The film features stop motion animated dinosaurs constructed by Jim Danforth,[4] including a Tyrannosaurus Rex which in one scene becomes intoxicated by a cannabis-type drug, animated by Randall W. Cook.[5] Danforth was a major participant in the special effects sequences, but left the film "about two-thirds of the way" (his words) through the work because the Directors Guild of America prohibited his contracted on-screen credit, co-direction with Carl Gottlieb. Consequently, Danforth's name does not appear on the film.[6] The film's dialog is almost entirely in "caveman" language, such as: "alunda" – love "bobo" – friend "haraka" – fire "macha" – monster "aiyee" – help "ya" – yes "nya" – no/not "ool" – food "pooka" – broken/pain "ugh" – like "zug zug" – sex/mate "kuda" – come "caca" – shit "guwi" – out to get "gluglug" – drowned At some showings audiences were issued a translation pamphlet for 30 "caveman words."[7] The only English dialog present is used for comedic effect, when it is spoken by a caveman played by Evan Kim who speaks modern English but is understood by none of the other characters. Being a Korean caveman, by speaking English, he appears to be more advanced than the rest. At her audition, Long said she did not speak any English, but responded to everything with grunts.[7] Barbara Bach and Ringo Starr first met on the set of Caveman, and they married just over a year later.[8] Home media[edit] The film was released on Region 1 DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on June 4, 2002. It was then released on February 17, 2015 on Blu-ray Disc by Olive Films.[9] Reception[edit] On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 26% based on reviews from 19 critics.[10] On Metacritic the film has a score of 55% based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[11] Roger Ebert gave the film 1.5 stars out of a possible 4. The cast was "interesting", he wrote, but the main failing of Caveman was it being a spoof with "no popular original material for it to satirize. There has never been a really successful movie set in prehistoric times."[12] Ebert and Gene Siskel both gave the film a negative "don't see it" review on their TV show but softened their criticism somewhat by noting that its dinosaur-related sequences were hilarious.[citation needed] Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that the film was "dopey, but it's also lots of fun", and that the real star was the special-effects dinosaur.[13] Pauline Kael of The New Yorker gave it a positive review, calling it "a funky, buoyant farce."[14] Gary Arnold of The Washington Post gave it a mixed review. He was critical with the lack of originality but suggests younger audiences who have not seen it before may enjoy it. Arnold compares the film unfavorably to The Three Ages, where Buster Keaton was able to bring his genius, Caveman struggles to overcome Starr's limits and director Gottlieb fails to make use of other talented actors such as Quaid, Schreiber, or Gilford.[15] Caveman was not a box-office success.[citation needed] References[edit] ^ a b "Caveman".
