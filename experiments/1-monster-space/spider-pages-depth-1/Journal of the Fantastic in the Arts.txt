The conference has been held in Orlando, Florida since 2008. The first ICFA was organized by Dr. Robert A. Collins of Florida Atlantic University in March 1980.[6] The conference was held on the FAU campus and was supported by a gift of operating funds provided by Margaret Gaines Swann, mother of the late FAU professor and fantasy author Dr. Thomas Burnett Swann. In the following years, the conference was held in Boca Raton, Florida, Beaumont and Houston, Texas, and in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, before settling in Orlando. The ICFA is organized into divisions by topic, which can change to reflect changing interests of the members. Current divisions include: fairy tales and folk narrative (added after the 2017 ICFA), fantasy literature, gothic and horror literature, the international fantastic, science fiction literature, visual and performing arts and audiences, film and television, and children's and young adult literature and art. Proposals for conference presentations are submitted to a specific division, which is selected by the proposer, for review by the appropriate division head. Anthologies of essays delivered at conferences from 1980 (published in the mid 80s) through 1994 have been called "the most comprehensive set of analyses of the fantastic in English."[7] As well as the presentation of research, the conference includes readings by invited authors, addresses by notable authors and scholars, workshops and social activities for students, and dramatic and sometimes humorous performances. Numerous invited authors attend each year's conference and the event includes one or more guests of honor, generally authors. Recent guests of honor include Jeff VanderMeer (2021), Terry Windling (2016), James K. Morrow (2015), Ian McDonald and Nnedi Okorafor (2014), Neil Gaiman and Kij Johnson (2013), China Miéville and Kelly Link (2012), and Terry Bisson and Connie Willis (2011).
