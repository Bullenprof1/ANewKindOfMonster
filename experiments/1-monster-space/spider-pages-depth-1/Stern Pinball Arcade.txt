Contents 1 Development 2 Tables 2.1 Table key 2.2 Published 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Development[edit] The game was announced on September 20, 2015 by FarSight Studios in partnership with Stern Pinball Inc. The game was revealed on May 2, 2016 to promote the subsequently cancelled Kickstarter campaign for the AC/DC pinball machine. Due to a new partnership, the intended funding was no longer necessary.[1][2] The first four tables launched for the game on Samsung Gear VR included Ripley's Believe It or Not!, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Star Trek and Starship Troopers. With the exception of Star Trek, these tables were previously released for The Pinball Arcade. The Steam (Windows) version released on December 22, 2016 to "Very Negative" reviews,[3] owing to widespread frustration with an apparently incomplete and buggy interface and inability to purchase DLC. Players recommending the game praised Farsight granting access to tables already purchased for The Pinball Arcade and expressed hope that issues would be resolved in the future.
