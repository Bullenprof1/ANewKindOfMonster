He was put up for adoption and raised in Hawaii by a white mother of Native American descent and Mexican-American father. As a child, his adoptive mother wanted to keep him occupied, so he took up dancing and martial arts as a way to balance himself. He went on to study Arashi-Ryu Karate, Taekwondo, Ninjutsu, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and Northern Shaolin, and mastered forms of hip hop dancing and breakdancing.[1] The surname "Storm" supposedly originated from a nickname and is related to one of the karate styles he trained in. Career[edit] Storm has starred in several major projects including Punisher: War Zone, Green Lantern, Avatar, Jack the Giant Slayer, and The Martial Arts Kid. He has also provided voice acting and motion capture for a variety of video games.[2] Filmography[edit] Film roles Year Title Role Notes 1991 Breathing Fire Mickey 1994 La quebradita Malo #2 1995 Dragon Fury Fullock Mortal Kombat Guest Fighter Uncredited Enter the Blood Ring Fighter 1997 Once Upon a Time in China and America Rival Tribe Indian Brave Kick of Death Abdul Sabbah 1999 Urban Menace King Direct-to-video Corrupt Cinque 2000 The Wrecking Crew Josef Guido Takes a Hike Gangster Short film Doomsdayer Pettigrew Montgomery Epoch of Lotus Officer 2001 A Month of Sundays Jamaican Taxi Driver The Ultimate Game Rick Fight choreographer The Organization J.C.
