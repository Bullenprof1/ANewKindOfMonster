Wikiquote has quotations related to: Category:Alien (franchise) The main article for this category is Alien (franchise). This category lists articles related to the Alien media franchise, an influential science fiction franchise that began with the 1979 film Alien. The film became a pop culture phenomenon and spawned three more feature films and an extensive collection of books, comics, video games, toys, and other products â€” all of which are set within a fictional future era. In 2004 the film series was officially crossed with the Predator series with the release of the film Alien vs. Predator (based on an earlier comic book), which was set in the present era. That film spawned a sequel and merchandise line of its own, merging the fictional storylines of the two franchises into a single continuity.
