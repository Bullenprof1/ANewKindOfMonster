The series ran from June 15, 2012, to February 15, 2016.[10][11][12] The series follows the adventures of Dipper Pines (voiced by Jason Ritter) and his twin sister Mabel (voiced by Kristen Schaal) who are sent to spend the summer with their great-uncle (or "Grunkle") Stan (voiced by Hirsch) in Gravity Falls, Oregon, a mysterious town full of paranormal forces and supernatural creatures. The kids help Stan run "the Mystery Shack", the tourist trap that he owns, while also investigating the local mysteries. On November 20, 2015, Hirsch announced that the series would finish with its second season, stating that this was "100% [his] choice" and that "the show isn't being cancelled- it's being finished" and was simply reaching its natural conclusion.[13][14] The show ended on February 15, 2016, with a one-hour finale, "Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls".[15][16] Hirsch later stated that he remains open to continuing the series with additional episodes or specials.[17] Gravity Falls received critical acclaim[18][19] with praise directed at its writing, characters, humor, and multi-generational appeal. Additionally, the series won two Emmy Awards, three Annie Awards, and a BAFTA Children's Award, among various other wins and nominations. Gravity Falls garnered high viewership amongst kids, teenagers, and young adults[5] during its run and was Disney XD's highest rated show in 2015[20] and early 2016,[21] while also setting several ratings records for the network.[20][22] The series has attracted a broad and passionate fandom[2] and has been considered to be an influence for many animated shows that followed it.[2][23] The series has also inspired a variety of official merchandise including books, toys, and a video game. In February 2018, on the second anniversary of the final episode of the show, Hirsch used a cipher to announce Gravity Falls: Lost Legends,[24] a continuation of the Gravity Falls story in a new graphic novel that was later released on July 24, 2018.[25] On August 8, 2020, Disney Channel aired a Gravity Falls-inspired episode of the show Amphibia, created by Matt Braly who served as a storyboard artist and director for the show. The episode is titled "Wax Museum", with Hirsch guest-starring.

Production[edit] Conception[edit] Gravity Falls's main production offices were located at Disney Television Animation in Glendale, California. Series creator Alex Hirsch at San Diego Comic-Con. Prior to working on the series, series creator Alex Hirsch's primary inspiration growing up was the popular animated sitcom The Simpsons, where he observed that "animation could be funnier than live-action.[29] That animation didn't have to just be for kids. That it could be satirical and observational and grounded in a sense of character interaction".[29] Hirsch graduated from the California Institute of the Arts, and was hired to work as writer and storyboard artist for the Cartoon Network series The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack, where he was paired up with Pendleton Ward, the creator of Adventure Time.[29] Afterwards, he moved on to co-develop the Disney Channel animated series Fish Hooks; shortly before he pitched (and was subsequently green-lit) Gravity Falls.[29] Hirsch says he was at the California Institute of the Arts when he turned down DreamWorks Animation executive Jeffrey Katzenberg out of a desire to work for Disney.[30] He first coined the concept for the show in an 11-minute low-budget student film that he made at the Institute.[31] Hirsch was called in to do a pitch for Disney Channel for a show based on the short pilot.[31] Disney Channel bought the idea and the series premiered on June 15, 2012.[11] The series was inspired by Hirsch's own childhood experiences and his relationship with his own twin sister growing up during their summer vacations.[32] He placed many of his real-life experiences in the show, like living in Piedmont and trick-or-treating with his sister as kids.[33] Dipper Pines is based on Hirsch's memory of how it felt to be a kid. When Hirsch was around Dipper's age, he "would record [him]self and play it backwards and try to learn to speak backwards."[34] Hirsch described himself as "that neurotic kid who would carry 16 disposable cameras everywhere I went."[32] Mabel Pines was inspired by his twin sister, Ariel Hirsch.[35] According to Hirsch, just like Mabel, his sister "really did wear wacky sweaters and have a different ridiculous crush, every week."[32] In the series Mabel gets a pet pig, just like his sister had always wanted when she was a kid.[36] Grunkle Stan was inspired by Hirsch's grandpa Stan, who according to Hirsch "was a guy that told tall tales and would frequently mess with us to get a rise out of us. So, my family really inspired the characters on the show."[32] Writing[edit] Hirsch explained in an interview with The A.V. Club that during the production of season 1, that a typical episode is conceived in a room reserved for writers, where a simple synopsis is presented, and from then on dramatic structure is defined, and the plot is modified to include a character-driven subplot, which Hirsch expresses as "the hardest thing ... to find a character story that actually uncovers, explores, or pushes tension—on something our characters care about—that is properly explored via the magic or monster or impossibility of the week."[29] B- and A-stories are created and are given to a writer to produce an outline, which is then subsequently checked-off by Hirsch for feedback. The writer produces a draft from these edits, where more notes may be given. Hirsch states that he and creative director Michael Rianda may personally create a draft for themselves before a final script is produced, in which the dialogue from the draft received from the writer is significantly revised; Hirsch states that the revising process "is not a discredit to our writers—it's just we have a very particular vision. In particular, I usually rewrite almost all of Dipper's dialogue and most of Mabel's dialogue, just because I have them in my head. Me and Mike will stay up for about 24 hours prior to the delivery of every script. We'll take the weekend, we'll work all night, we'll drink Red Bull, we'll sleep on the couch in shifts like maniacs, we'll slap each other in the face."[29] Animation[edit] After a script is delivered, an episode then gets translated into a storyboard, where feedback is received from Hirsch to the board artists if a certain element, such as a gag, doesn't work. Afterwards, a pitch for the episode is given to the network, where they do a read-through, and then the episode is either checked out by the network, or retooled in the small amount of time allocated before an animation studio must receive something to work with.[29] The series is animated by Rough Draft Korea, Digital eMation and Yearim Productions.[37] However, whenever a sequence was deemed too important for the outside animation studios to realize, it was animated in-house by storyboard artist and supervisor Dana Terrace.[38] Broadcast[edit] Initial broadcast[edit] The first twelve episodes of Gravity Falls aired in a regular weekly slot on Disney Channel starting in mid-2012, but subsequent episodes were broadcast without similar regularity; it took until August 2013 to broadcast the remaining eight episodes of the first season. The second season began airing a year later in August 2014, transitioning over to Disney XD, but again without any regularity as to when new episodes would be first broadcast. The first nine episodes aired from August to November 2014, the following two in February and March 2015, the next eight from July to November 2015, and the finale aired on February 15, 2016. According to Disney XD, as each episode took about six months of work to complete, they opted against stockpiling episodes to show weekly but instead take advantage of the serial nature of the show, broadcasting each episode as it was completed and making an event out of it.[39] On April 2, 2018, reruns of the show started airing on Disney Channel, although reruns of the show still air on Disney XD.[40] International broadcast[edit] The series began airing on Disney Channel Canada on September 1, 2015, following Corus Entertainment's acquisition of Disney Channel rights in Canada. In Canada the show began airing on Disney XD starting on December 1, 2015, following the launch of Disney XD. The show started broadcasting in the United Kingdom and Ireland on July 20, 2012, as a preview and officially premiered on September 7, 2012.[41] In Australia and New Zealand it previewed on August 17, 2012, and premiered on September 24, 2012.[42] It also premiered in Southeast Asia on October 27, 2012.[43] In India it premiered on September 16, 2013.[44] In the Middle East region, the series was previewed on October 19, 2012, and premiered on November 10, 2012.[citation needed] The series preview debuted in Canada on June 15, 2012, and premiered on July 6, 2012, on Family Channel, until January 2016 when it moved to the local Disney XD channel following Corus Entertainment's acquisition of Disney Channel rights in Canada from Family's owner DHX Media.[45] In Australia, the show airs on Disney XD and 7mate[46] while in Chile, the show was broadcast on Canal 13 on November 24, 2013, under its programming block CuBox. In the Philippines, the show was shown on TV5 beginning on May 4, 2014, while in Brazil, the show also began airing on Rede Globo on May 10, 2014.[47] In Indonesia, the show premiered on RCTI on August 17, 2014.[48] Broadcast edits[edit] The symbol on Grunkle Stan's fez was changed from a crescent shape resembling the Islamic crescent to a fish-like symbol mid-way through the first season's broadcast.[49] The symbol represents his membership in the Royal Order of the Holy Mackerel.[49] When the series was put on Disney+, the crescent-shaped symbol was edited out entirely, leaving a symbol-less fez in the early episodes—later episodes featuring the fish-like symbol were unaffected.[49] However, the crescent symbol remains in the thumbnails, and on the zodiac wheel in the title sequence.[49] Hirsch drew attention to the change on Twitter. Disney has not commented on why it was removed.[49] Sometime later, the symbol on the fez was restored.[49] In 2017, Disney Channel redubbed Louis C.K.'s minor role as "The Horrifying Sweaty One-Armed Monstrosity" in the 2015 episode "Weirdmageddon: Part 1", as well as its 2016 follow-up episode, "Weirdmageddon: Part 3: Take Back The Falls", following the comedian's admission of sexual misconduct. Series creator Alex Hirsch is now credited as playing the character.[50][51] Merchandise[edit] Home media[edit] DVDs Title Release date Discs Episodes Ref.

Smart, satirical, and sweet. Gravity Falls was a one-of-a-kind gem."[87] Michelle Jaworski writing for The Daily Dot described Gravity Falls as "[A] classic summer story woven into a smart and addictive show tackling the paranormal, the supernatural, and the pains of growing up."[88] IndieWire’s Michael Schneider said "Gravity Falls is a kids’ show so dense with mythology, pop culture jokes, Easter eggs, and mystery that grown-ups were often more invested."[89] Joey Keogh from Den of Geek wrote "Gravity Falls, is a spooky-cute must-watch for adults who never grew out of Halloween."[90] Donna Dickens from Uproxx said "Not only does Gravity Falls deal with the inexplicable supernatural occurrences in the town, the whole thing is just one big puzzle of secrets waiting for fans to uncover and solve."[91] Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club said "With a complex mythology and a deep lexicon of cultural references, there’s sophistication to the show’s epic storytelling that immediately drew the attention of a wider audience."[92] Liz Baessler writing for Film School Rejects said "Gravity Falls is an exceptional kids’ show — brilliant, hilarious, and carefully crafted."[93] In 2015, Uproxx ranked Gravity Falls as the 3rd Current Kids Cartoon That Adults Need to be Watching.[91] In 2018, IndieWire ranked Gravity Falls at number 12 on their list of The 50 Best Animated Series Of All Time.[89] In 2019, Yardbarker ranked Gravity Falls at number 21 on their list of The 25 Greatest Animated Shows of All Time.[94] Also in 2019, IGN placed Gravity Falls at Number 19 on their list titled The 25 Best Adult Cartoon TV Series[87] and The A.V. Club placed Gravity Falls at number 48 on their list of The 100 Best TV Shows of the 2010s.[92] Ratings[edit] A special preview of the series following the Disney Channel Original Movie Let It Shine was watched by 3.4 million viewers.[95] The series garnered high viewership on its fifth episode, which aired on July 13, 2012, and attracted 3.6 million viewers. On March 15, 2013, the episode "The Deep End" was watched by 4.5 million viewers after the premiere of Wizards of Waverly Place's The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex, becoming the highest-rated episode of the series.[96] Later moving on to Disney XD, the episode "A Tale of Two Stans" became the highest-rated telecast ever on Disney XD, with 1.91 million viewers.[97] In addition to total viewers, "A Tale of Two Stans" also set a network record in kids ages 2–11 (1.036 million), boys ages 2–11 (686,000), boys ages 6–11 (574,000), kids ages 6–14 (1.279 million) and boys ages 6–14 (856,000).[22] In 2015, Gravity Falls accounted for Disney XD's top seven regular animated series telecasts of all time among kids ages 6–11.[22] During the week of July 12–18, 2015, Gravity Falls was the top-rated program in its 8:30 p.m. timeslot across kids and boys ages 2–11, 6–11 and 6–14. That same week, it was also cable TV’s number 1 scripted telecast in total viewers, according to estimates from Nielsen Ratings.[22][98] Gravity Falls ranked as Disney XD's number 1 series of 2015 across all target demographics[20] with an average of 1.8 million viewers per episode.[5] Additionally, Gravity Falls ranked as 2015's third animated cable TV series in boys ages 9–14.[20] In kids ages 6–11, the series averaged 654,000 viewers and 790,000 in kids ages 2–11. Among boys ages 6–14 it pulled in 680,000 views.[5] That is strong viewership in Disney XD's core demographics, but it also makes it clear that older teens and young adults make up more than half of the show's audience according to Variety.[5] In February 2016, Gravity Falls was the number 1 regular series telecast on record across kids ages 6–11 (1.0 million/4.4 rating), boys ages 6–11 (642,000/5.3 rating), kids ages 2–11 (1.3 million/3.4 rating) and boys ages 2–11 (797,000/4.0 rating).[21] The series finale "Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls" beat the ratings record previously held by "A Tale of Two Stans" becoming Disney XD's most-watched telecast ever, with 2.47 million viewers in the United States. "Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls" also established new all-time network highs in kids ages 6–14 (1.5 million/4.1 rating) and boys ages 6–14 (909,000/5.0 rating).[21] The all-day Gravity Falls marathon that preceded the premiere of "Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls" generated 10.7 million unique total viewers, of which 5.4 million were kids ages 2–14.[21] Influence and legacy[edit] Fans cosplaying as Dipper and Mabel at Montreal Comiccon in 2015. Gravity Falls has been considered to be an influence for many animated shows that followed it, including Steven Universe, Star vs. the Forces of Evil, The Owl House and Rick and Morty.[2][23] Other examples of the show's influence include LGBT representation and series-long story arcs as opposed to isolated single-episode stories.[2][23][99][100] The show also maintains a loyal and passionate fandom, even years after the series finale.[2][101][102] The creator of the show hid a variety of codes, cryptograms, backwards messages, and other secret clues for fans find in every episode, which often contributed to the show's mysteries and lore.[1][102][103][104][105] Some have compared Gravity Falls to more adult-oriented mystery shows like Lost,[5][106] Twin Peaks[1][101][103][107][108] and The X-Files.[5][101][107] While it was on the air, the show was Disney XD's highest rated series, with an average of 1.8 million viewers per episode.[5][101][107] In the summer of 2016, Gravity Falls' creator Alex Hirsch threw an international treasure hunt known as the "Cipher Hunt", the goal of which was to find the real-life Bill Cipher statue briefly glimpsed in the series finale.[109][110][111][112] It began on July 20, 2016[113] and finished on August 3, 2016.[114] The hunt involved retrieving and decoding riddles and codes hidden in various locations all over the world.[111][115] One clue involved a 2,000-piece jigsaw puzzle that took several days to complete with someone almost always working on it.[116][117] On August 3, 2016, the statue was found in a forest in Reedsport, Oregon.[115] While the first ones to the statue received various prizes,[111][115] Hirsch made it clear that the hunt itself was the real treasure.[110][118] On August 3, the statue was removed by authorities due to a property dispute[111][119] and was temporarily held at the Reedsport police department while Hirsch arranged for it to be moved somewhere else.[119] By August 5, the statue temporarily ended up in Bicentennial Park in Reedsport,[120] before being permanently relocated to Confusion Hill in Piercy, California a few weeks later.[119][121] In celebration of the release of Journal 3 and the end of the Gravity Falls series, Oh My Disney and Cyclops Print Works teamed up with Gallery Nucleus[122] in Alhambra, California to hold an official Gravity Falls art show, titled Farewell to the Falls: A Gravity Falls Art Show, on August 6–21, 2016.[123][124][125] Creator Alex Hirsch along with other production staff and professional illustrators contributed new and original artwork to this exhibition. Some fans camped out overnight to see the show[126] and some works of art sold for over $1,000.[123] On August 8, 2020, Disney Channel aired a Gravity Falls-inspired episode of the show Amphibia

Disney ultimately passed on the project, as the studio felt the show "wasn't big enough to warrant [a film]"; Hirsch said he was still interested in the idea.[167] During an interview with Inverse in 2021, Hirsch expressed interest in continuing the story of Gravity Falls in the form of a video game that "is really, really in-depth to the lore of the series and includes new canon that has been in the periphery of the series."[168] Notes[edit] ^ This is the date the pilot was released on DVD. Prior to this, the pilot was released online on August 3, 2016 as a reward from Alex Hirsch for completing the 2,000 piece jigsaw puzzle that was a clue in the Cipher Hunt. ^ The first episode of season 1 premiered as a series preview. The series made its official premiere on Disney Channel on June 29, 2012. ^ The first episode of season 2 premiered on Disney Channel. The second season officially began on August 4, 2014 on Disney XD, the new network for the series. References[edit] ^ a b c Stacy Conradt (January 8, 2016). "18 Fun Facts About Gravity Falls".
