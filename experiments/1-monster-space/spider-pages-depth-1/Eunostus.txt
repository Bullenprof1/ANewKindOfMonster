This article is about the goddess. For the hero, see Eunostus (hero). For the genus of beetle, see Eunostus (beetle). In Greek mythology, Eunostus[pronunciation?] or Eunostos was a goddess whose image was set up in mills, and who was believed to keep watch over the just weight of flour.[1][2][3] Promylaia ("the one that stands before/protects the mill") was another name for a goddess of the mills, who was worshipped in the same fashion as Eunostus.[4] Both Eunostus and Promylaia could actually have been mere epithets of Demeter.[5] References[edit] ^ Hesychius of Alexandria s. v. ^ Eustathius on Homer, pp. 214, 1383 ^ Suda s. v.
