Composed by Austrian Harald Kloser, Kloser was chosen by the film's director Paul W. S. Anderson, as he was an enthusiastic fan of the series. The score is completely orchestral and was released on August 9, 2004 on iTunes[2] and on August 31, 2004 on Audio CD and Compact Cassette via Varèse Sarabande label.[3] Contents 1 Reviews 2 Track listing 3 Selected credits 4 References Reviews[edit] The soundtrack received mixed reviews from critics. Mike Brennan thought it "lacks the ingenuity of the previous trilogy (Alien) and the Predator scores, which all shared a strong sense of rhythm in place of thematic content. Kloser throws in some interesting percussion cues ("Antarctica" and "Down the Tunnel"), but more as a sound effect than a consistent motif."[4] John Fallon of JoBlo.com compared it to character development in the movie, "too generic to completely engage or leave a permanent impression."[5] James Christopher Monger of Allmusic awarded the album 3.5 out of 5, and thought Kloser introduced electronic elements well, and called "Alien vs. Predator Main Theme" a, "particularly striking and serves as a continuous creative source for the composer to dip his baton in".[6] Track listing[edit] No. Title Length 1.
