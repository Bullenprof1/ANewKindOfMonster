According to the digital sheet music published by EMI Music Publishing, the song was originally composed in the key of E minor and set in common time to a "fast" tempo of 176 BPM.[5] The song follows a chord progression of Em—A5—Em / Em—B7(no 3)—Em—G, while King's vocals span a range of two octaves and one note, from B3 through C5.[5] Critics have also noted influences of soul[7] and blues genres.[8] Reception[edit] Critical[edit] In a review of the Ghostbusters soundtrack, James Monger of AllMusic praised "Good Girls" and "Get Ghost" as highlights, writing, "Mark Ronson... gets the vibe right on the hook-filled... "Get Ghost"..., and Elle King dispatches the sassy girl power jam "Good Girls," but the rest of the set feels rushed and forgettable."[9] Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound gave a glowing review of the song, writing, "much like her past earworms... ["Good Girls" is] fucking nuclear, wired with dozens of hooks and made urgent by scandalous lyrics that go hand in hand with the majority of today's nihilistic pop."[10] Commercial[edit] "Good Girls" debuted and peaked at number 29 on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart dated June 25, 2016.[11] The song also entered the Rock Digital Songs and Alternative Digital Songs component charts at 10 and 11, respectively, for the same week.[12][13] "Good Girls" entered the Billboard Adult Alternative Songs airplay chart at number 24 on the chart dated August 13, 2016 and reached a peak position of 21 two weeks later.[14] Music video[edit] The accompanying music video for "Good Girls" was directed by Dano Cerny and premiered July 13, 2016.[15] It takes place first in a haunted laundromat and later in a dive bar, where King can be seen playing pool, smoking a cigar, and arm wrestling.[16][17] King dyed her hair blue for the video, with the makeup artist responsible for the clip, Michelle Clark, describing the goal of the visual styling as "badass."[18] Tying in the film concept, King's character dispatches a handful of ghosts with the franchise's signature proton gun. Towards the end of the video, clips of the film are showcased.[16][17] Performances and promotion[edit] King appeared on the July 15, 2016 episode of Good Morning America to promote the single and the Ghostbusters film, and performed "Good Girls" live.[19] Charts[edit] Chart (2016) Peak position US Hot Rock & Alternative Songs (Billboard)[11] 29 Release history[edit] Country Date Format Label Ref.
