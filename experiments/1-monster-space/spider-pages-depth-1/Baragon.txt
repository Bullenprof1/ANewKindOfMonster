Kaiju film or creature Not to be confused with Barragon or Barugon. Baragon Godzilla film series character First appearance Frankenstein Conquers the World (1965) Created by Eiji Tsuburaya Portrayed by Shōwa series: Haruo Nakajima Millenium series: Rie Ōta In-universe information Species Dinosaur-like creature Baragon (バラゴン) is a fictional monster, or kaiju, which first appeared in Ishirō Honda's 1965 film Frankenstein Conquers the World, produced and distributed by Toho. Depicted as a four-legged, horned dinosaur-like creature with large ears,[1] Baragon would go on to appear alongside Godzilla and other monster characters in films in the Godzilla franchise, also produced by Toho, including Destroy All Monsters and Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack.[2] Contents 1 Overview 1.1 Showa series 1.2 Millennium series 1.3 Abilities 2 Appearances 2.1 Films 2.2 Television 2.3 Video games 2.4 Literature 2.5 Cultural references 3 References Overview[edit] Showa series[edit] In the film Frankenstein Conquers the World, Baragon is depicted as a dinosaur that burrowed underground to escape the extinction of the dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures. It adapted and survived over the years, but when the sounds of a nearby factory disturb and awaken him during the events of the film, Baragon emerges from underground and attacks the factory. It later attacks and destroys a village and eats all of a farm's livestock. As Baragon was not sighted in the attacks, the mutant human Frankenstein was blamed for them until a survivor of the factory attack came forward, citing a different monster attacked him. While searching for Frankenstein, a group of scientists set off explosives, which attracts Baragon. It attacks the scientists, but Frankenstein arrives to protect them. The two engage each other in battle, with the latter defeating Baragon by breaking his neck. While Frankenstein was victorious, a fissure opened up and swallowed both combatants. In the film Destroy All Monsters, a different Baragon is seen as one of several of Earth's monsters kept in captivity on Monster Island. They were brainwashed by the alien Kilaaks and sent to destroy Earth's major cities as part of their invasion, but a group of human astronauts destroyed the Kilaaks' control device. In retaliation, the aliens sent King Ghidorah to kill Earth's monsters. Most of them engaged and eventually killed the space dragon in combat, though Baragon did not take part in either. Following this, Earth's monsters returned to Monster Island to live in peace. Millennium series[edit] In the film Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack, Baragon is depicted as one of Japan's three ancient guardian monsters. When Godzilla is revived by the vengeful souls of the people who died in World War II, Baragon and his fellow guardians Mothra and King Ghidorah are revived to confront him. While the three are ultimately killed in battle, they weakened Godzilla enough for Admiral Taizo Tachibana of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) to kill it in turn. Abilities[edit] All incarnations of Baragon are adept burrowers, with the Millennium incarnation even being referred to as the "God of the Earth". The latter incarnation is also capable of leaping great distances.
