Japanese actor Kenpachiro Satsuma (薩摩剣八郎, Satsuma Kenpachirō, born May 27, 1947, in Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan) is a Japanese actor who is probably best known for playing Godzilla in the Heisei series of Godzilla films (1984–1995), but played other giant monsters (daikaijū) like Gigan and Hedorah.[1] While filming Godzilla movies, Satsuma would regularly pass out on the set due to lack of oxygen while wearing the poorly ventilated and rubber suits; this was especially a problem during production of Godzilla vs. Destoroyah, in which the steam effect on the suit (meant to represent Godzilla going into meltdown) was achieved using pure carbon dioxide.[2] Films[edit] Godzilla vs. Hedorah (1971) as Hedorah Godzilla vs. Gigan (1972) as Gigan Godzilla vs. Megalon (1973) as Gigan Prophecies of Nostradamus (1974) G.I.
