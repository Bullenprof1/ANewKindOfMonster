After losing 50 men, the Apache retreated up the mountain later named Apache Leap. Accepting defeat, the remaining Apache leapt to their death rather than being captured by the US cavalry.[6] Superior was originally called Queen, then Hastings, and under the latter name was platted in 1900.[7] Queen had a population of around 100 circa 1880. There was a general store, 2 hotels, numerous saloons, and a post office. The Queen post office closed Sept. 15, 1881.[8] The Superior townsite was laid out in 1902, and named after the Lake Superior and Arizona Copper Company (LS&A). The Superior post office opened on December 29, 1902.[8] Magma Mine[edit] Magma Arizona Railroad in Superior, 1967 The origin of Magma Mine began on March 22, 1875, when Charles G. Mason and four companions found native silver, and staked the Silver King claim. On March 29, 1875, the Silver Queen (Magma) vein was staked, and the Silver Queen Mining Company was organized in 1880. However, with the depletion of silver, the Silver Queen shut down in 1893, and the Silver King in 1896. In 1910, William Boyce Thompson and George Gunn bought the Silver Queen mine, and organized the Magma Copper Company. A 300-ton-per-day concentrator was built in 1914. In 1915, a narrow-gauge railway connected Superior with the Southern Pacific Railroad, which was converted to standard gauge in 1923. A smelter was built in 1924.[9] After 71 years of production, the Magma mine closed in August 1982 due to high operating costs and declining copper prices. Operations resumed in September 1990, but the mine closed again on June 28, 1996. During its 86-year life (1910–1996). the Magma mine produced approximately 27.6 million short tons of ore averaging about 4.9% copper, recovering 1,299,718 short tons of copper, 36,550 short tons of zinc, approximately 686,000 ounces of gold and 34.3 million ounces of silver.[10] The old Magma No. 9 shaft atop Apache Leap is being used to explore the huge Resolution Copper deposit below.
