Turkish adaptations of Hollywood films Turksploitation is a tongue-in-cheek label given to a great number of Turkish low-budget exploitation films that are either remakes of, or use unauthorized footage from, popular foreign films (particularly Hollywood movies) and television series, produced mainly in the 1970s and 1980s.[1] Der Spiegel labeled these films the "most sympathetic and anarchical subgenre of exploitation film". Filmed on a shoestring budget with often comically simple special effects and no regard for copyright, Turksploitation films substituted exuberant inventiveness and zany plots for technical and acting skill, although noted Turkish actors did feature in some of these productions.[1] The original soundtracks of the original film or of other Hollywood films were often reused. On occasion whole segments of the original film, such as special effects shots, were copied into the adaptation.[1] List of Turksploitation films[edit] Noted examples of Turksploitation films include:[1] 3 Dev Adam ("Three Big Men"), 1973. Features two heroes costumed as Captain America and Santo (a Mexican wrestler) a villain costumed as Spider-Man, and reuses the soundtrack of James Bond movies. Altın Çocuk ("Golden Boy"), 1966.
