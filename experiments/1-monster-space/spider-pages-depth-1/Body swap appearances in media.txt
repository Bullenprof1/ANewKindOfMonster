Body swaps, first popularized in the personal identity chapter of John Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding,[1] have been a common storytelling device in fiction media. Novels such as Vice Versa (1882)[2] and Freaky Friday (1972)[3] have inspired numerous film adaptations and retellings, as well as television series and episodes, many with titles derived from "Freaky Friday". In 2013, Disney Channel held a Freaky Freakend with seven shows that featured body-swapping episodes.[a] This list features exchanges between two beings, and thus excludes similar phenomena of body hopping, spirit possession, transmigration,[5] and avatars, unless the target being's mind is conversely placed in the source's body.[6][7] It also excludes age transformations that are sometimes reviewed or promoted as body swaps, as in the movies Big and 17 Again;[6][8][9] identity/role swaps, typically between twins, clones, look-alikes, or doppelgängers;[10] and characters with multiple personalities.[6] Contents 1 Books 2 Short stories and operas 3 Films 4 Television 4.1 Shows with body swaps 4.2 Episodes with body swaps 5 Video games 6 Graphic novels and manga 7 See also 8 Notes 9 References 10 External links Books[edit] Title Author Year Characters Method / notes Reference Du bist ich und ich bin du (転校生!おれがあいつであいつがおれで) Hisashi Yamanaka 1980 A boy and girl switch bodies Magic [11] Agent Cormac book series Neal Asher 2001–2008 Cormac, Mika, Aiden, Stanton, Dragon, Crane Artificial intelligence transfers to different bodies; downloads of human minds into artificial carriers and cyborg bodies [12] Airhead book series Meg Cabot 2008 Emerson Watts (tomboy) and Nikki Howard (teenage supermodel) brain transplant[b] [13] Alice & Gabby's Excellent Adventure Maya Rodale 2020 Gabrielle Fox and Lady Alice Fellows from England in 1819 Lightnng strikes The Anubis Gates Tim Powers 1983 Doyle and Dog-Face Joe   OCLC 10259963 The Barking Ghost R.
