She was a daughter of the goddess Nyx. According to Hesiod's Theogony, she represented sexual and social intercourse. Her siblings are said to be, among others, Apate (Deceit) and Nemesis (Indignation).[1] She was described by Empedocles as one of the driving forces behind creation, being paired together with Neikea (Feuds); Philotes being the force behind good things and Neikea being the force of bad things.[2] He also identifies her with Kypris[3] and mentions that Philotes feels hurt and offended by life-destroying offerings and demands the abstention from animal sacrifices.[4] References[edit] ^ Stephen Scully (2015).
