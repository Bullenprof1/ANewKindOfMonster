This article is about the Oceanid nymph. For the mother of Tantalus, see Plouto (mother of Tantalus). In Greek mythology, Plouto or Pluto (Πλουτώ "Wealth") was, according to the late 8th–early 7th century BC Greek poet Hesiod, and the probably nearly as old Homeric Hymn 2 to Demeter, one of the many Oceanid daughters of Oceanus and Tethys.[1] Hesiod calls her "soft eyed", and the Homeric Hymn has her as one of the "deep-bosomed daughters of Oceanus" who were the playmates of Persephone when she was abducted by Hades.
