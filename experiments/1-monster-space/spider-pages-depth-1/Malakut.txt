Invisible realm in Islamic cosmology Al-Malakut meaning Realm of Dominion (Arabic: عالم الملكوت‎), also known as "Hurqalya",[1] is an invisible realm, in Islamic cosmology, containing several metaphysical beings and places in Islamic lore, like angels, demons, jinn, hell and the seven heavens.[2] It is sometimes used interchangeably with Alam al Mithal, but otherwise distinguished from it, as a realm above Alam al Mithal, but still sublunary to Alam al Jabarut, as a lower plane for angels, but still higher than the plane of jinn.[3] The higher realms are not separated worlds in Islamic thought, rather they impinge the realms below.[4] Imaginal Realm[edit] The realm called Al Malakut or Alam al Mithal (translated as imaginal realm) terms the concept of a realm where all ideas, thoughts and actions are manifested, including supernatural experiences,[5] conversations with angels and encounters with jinn.[6] Additionally, the lower soul (nafs), came from there and the dreamer enters this realm again during sleep.[7] It is held to be between the material realm (Alam al Mulk) and the spiritual realm (Alam al Jabarut).[8] See also[edit] Barzakh Jabulqa and Jabulsa Malkuth Sufi cosmology Yetzirah References[edit] ^ Corbin, Henry (1977).
