Plot[edit] The film documents the Ghostbusters fan community, presented mainly through the story of New Jersey resident Tom Gebhardt.[1][9] In general, the documentary shows how Ghostbusters film affection helped various people through life.[10] Reception[edit] The film was highly anticipated by the Ghostbusters film fans,[11] however, some of them were critical to the very idea of making such a film.[12] A popular critical comment to the film was that its subjects were almost overwhelmingly white and male.[10][9] As of January 26, 2020, Rotten Tomatoes has not rated it on the tomato meter, but 65% of reporting fans liked it.[13] References[edit] ^ a b c Nick Vadala (June 29, 2016).
