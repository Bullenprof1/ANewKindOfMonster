In a nearby town that has been overrun by gang belonging to Boss Iwagoro, Zatoichi disturbes the gangsters' gambling scam and hides away with the town's blacksmith Senzo. Senzo turns out to be the apprentice to the master swordsmith who forged Zatoichi's cane sword. Senzo spots a crack in the blade and warns that it will snap after one more kill. At the inn where Zatoichi takes a job as a masseur, the innkeeper Gembei has taken in Shotaro's daughter Shizu and son Seikichi. Shizu wants her brother to take their father's place as the new boss and keep the evil Boss Iwagoro from taking over, but the scholarly Seikichi has no interest in the family business. During his stay at the inn Zatoichi discovers Iwagoro is in cahoots with a corrupt government official, Inspector Kuwayama.

Ichi's very invulnerability makes for a certain relaxation, a few songs, a little buffoonery, and much of it to the good."[2] References[edit] ^ "Zatoichi's Cane Sword". The Criterion Collection.
