"different world" or "otherworld") is a genre of light novels, manga, anime and video games that revolve around a person from Earth who is transported to and has to survive in another world, such as a fantasy world, virtual world or parallel universe. This plot device allows the audience to learn about the new world at the same pace as the protagonist. Isekai works can also often fall under the fantasy, science fiction, portal fantasy or accidental travel genres. Often, the protagonist is depicted as already being familiar with the parallel world, as it is a pre-existing fictional universe in their world. It is also common for the parallel world to be unknown to them, as is the case with 'Reverse Isekai' stories such as Sonic X and Isekai Quartet. The new universe can be an entirely different alien world where only the protagonist retains knowledge and has any memory of their former life, as in Saga of Tanya the Evil and Ascendance of a Bookworm. How the protagonist gets there can vary greatly: in some media, they are reincarnated into that world after dying; in others, they are summoned or teleported to that world by accidental or intended reasons, as in the case of Isekai Cheat Magician; or they may unknowingly have walked through a portal connecting two worlds, as in the case of Spirited Away and Inuyasha. In Sorcerous Stabber Orphen, an entire population of humans appeared in the magically created world was transported from Earth and got partially mixed with local dragonlike Heavenly Beings.[1] Isekai may also take place in the virtual world of a massively multiplayer online (MMO) game, such as .hack and Sword Art Online, and it may also be one where a formerly virtual world turns into a real one, such as in Log Horizon and Overlord.

The latter, more common in newer works, sees the protagonist die in their original world and then be reborn in another world, or otherwise inhabit (or swap place with) the body of a person already existing in the other world. The common usage of sudden collisions with trucks as plot devices in the deaths of the main protagonist led to a popular internet meme, affectionately referring to the often-generic trucks as if they were a singular entity named "truck-kun".[3] This was parodied in KonoSuba, where the main protagonist, believing he died saving someone from a truck, was later revealed to actually have been hit by a slow-moving tractor, instead dying of shock-induced cardiac arrest. The new world could be a literal new world, such as an alternate planet or fantasy reality; a new-to-the-protagonist world, such as a historical, real-world setting; or a fictional new world, such as the protagonist waking up in a book, film, or video game. In some works the person being transported is a NEET, shut-in, gamer (as in No Game No Life), or overworked salaryman/woman (as in By the Grace of the Gods), who in the new fantasy world, are now are able to succeed through use of their comparatively unimportant-in-real-life genre knowledge or skills, or they may have special skills or equipment, such as a game interface only they can access.[4][5] Their power can range from tremendous magical abilities surpassing anyone else (as in In Another World with My Smartphone),[4] to relatively weak, as in Re:Zero, where the protagonist does not gain any special power beyond the ability to survive death in a type of temporal loop.[6] These common isekai cliches and tropes are often parodied in such works as KonoSuba, where the protagonist Kazuma Satou receives no powers, and is forced to develop as a character in the typical fantasy setting "from the ground up". In some examples, the main character is an ordinary person who thrives in their new environment thanks to some normal skills they learned in their previous life such as cooking, engineering or medicine, which are far more advanced in modern Japan than in the world they are sent to. While the protagonist of a classic isekai work is usually a "chosen hero", there have been a large number of alternative takes on the concept. One trend is the protagonist inhabiting the body of an unimportant side character, or villain (as in My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!). In Drifters, the people entering the fantasy world are historical generals and other warriors who are more brutal than the inhabitants of the world themselves,[7] and in That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, where the protagonist starts as a slime with special abilities rather than a human.[8] Some stories involve people being reincarnated as unusual inanimate objects, like a magical onsen.[9] Others, known as "reverse isekai", follow beings from a fantasy universe who have been transported to or reincarnated on modern-day Earth, including the anime Laidbackers and Re:Creators.[10] There are also some works, referred to as "two-way isekai", in which beings from both modern-day Earth and a fantasy universe interact inside each other's worlds such as GATE and Fushigi Yûgi. An offshoot of the isekai genre is the "second chance" or "reincarnation" genre, where a protagonist who, upon dying, finds themselves transported, not to a different world and new body, but into their own younger self. With their new knowledge and older intellect, they are able to relive their life avoiding their previous pitfalls. In many works, isekai overlaps with the harem genre, where the protagonist gains the affections of several potential love interests, who may or may not be human. History[edit] The concept has origins in ancient Japanese literature, particularly the story of Urashima Tarō, a widely known folk tale in Japan that isekai writers grew up with. It is about the fisherman Urashima Tarō, who saves a turtle and is brought to a wondrous undersea kingdom, but the story has a twist: after spending what he believed to be four to five days there, he returns to his home village only to find himself 300 years in the future.[11] The folk tale was adapted into one of the earliest anime films, Seitaro Kitayama's Urashima Tarō, in 1918.[12] Other precursors to isekai include portal fantasy stories from English literature, notably the novels Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865), A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889),The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900), Peter Pan (1902), and The Chronicles of Narnia (1950).[11] Modern Japanese media[edit] Early anime and manga titles that could be classified as isekai include Aura Battler Dunbine (1983 debut),[13] Mashin Hero Wataru (1988 debut) NG Knight Ramune & 40 (1990 debut) Fushigi Yûgi (1992 debut) and El-Hazard (1995 debut), in which the protagonists stayed similar to their original appearance upon entering a different world.[4][14] Other 1990s titles identified as isekai include the novel and anime series The Twelve Kingdoms (1992 debut),[15] the manga/anime/game franchise Magic Knight Rayearth (1993 debut),[15][14] the visual novel adventure game YU-NO: A Girl Who Chants Love at the Bound of this World (1996),[16][17] the manga and anime series InuYasha (1996 debut),[14] and the anime series Now and Then, Here and There and Digimon Adventure (1999 debut).[14] The anime film Spirited Away (2001) was one of the first worldwide known isekai anime films, although the term "isekai" was not commonly used at the time. The role-playing adventure game Moon: Remix RPG Adventure (1997),[18] and the Digimon Adventure (1999 debut)[14] and .hack (2002 debut) franchises, were some of the first works to present the concept of isekai as a virtual world, with Sword Art Online (2002 web novel debut) following in their footsteps.[19] Another isekai anime series from the 2000s is Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi (2002).[14] A popular isekai light novel and anime series in the 2000s was The Familiar of Zero (Zero no Tsukaima) (2004 debut), where the male lead Saito is from modern Japan and is summoned to a fantasy world by the female lead Louise.[20][14] The Familiar of Zero popularized the isekai genre in web novel and light novel media, along with the website Shōsetsuka ni Narō ("Let's Become Novelists"), known as Narō for short. The Familiar of Zero fan fiction became popular on Narō during the late 2000s, eventually spawning a genre of isekai ("other world") novels on the site, which became known as Narō novels. The Familiar of Zero fan fiction writers eventually began writing original isekai novels, such as Tappei Nagatsuki who went on to create Re:Zero (2012 debut). The 2012 anime adaptation of Sword Art Online popularized the isekai genre in anime, which led to more isekai web novels being published on Narō and a number of Narō novels being adapted into anime. It was around this time that the term "isekai" was coined.[21] Later titles such as Knight's & Magic (2010 debut) and The Saga of Tanya the Evil (2013 debut) involved their protagonists dying and being reincarnated in a different world.[4][22] The most influential isekai novel in that regard was Mushoku Tensei (2012 debut), which began as a Narō novel and popularized the reincarnation sub-genre of isekai while establishing a number of common isekai tropes. Mushoku Tensei was the most popular Narō novel for a number of years, and thus served as a point of reference for numerous isekai writers that followed.[21] The genre eventually became so popular that in 2016, a Japanese short story contest organized by Bungaku Free Market and Shōsetsuka ni Narō banned any isekai entries.[23] The publisher Kadokawa banned isekai stories as well in their own anime/manga-style novel contest in 2017.[24] Modern media in other countries[edit] Isegye (Korean: 이세계; Hanja: 異世界; RR: Isegye), as the genre is known in South Korea, has also grown in popularity with many web novels, webtoons and manhwa being released featuring the same themes. Many of these titles have also been translated and released overseas and have seen levels of popularity similar to Japanese isekai manga and anime.[25] Fusion Fantasy (Korean: 퓨전 판타지; RR: Pyujeon pantaji) is a genre created by fusion of fantasy and wuxia or oriental world, and this is a South Korean term for isekai. This was popular in the 2000s.[26] While the term isekai typically refers to Japanese fictional works, the term has also been applied to modern fictional works from other countries that contain isekai elements. Other examples include the Chinese–American film Forbidden Kingdom (2008) starring Jackie Chan and Jet Li, and the American novel Ready Player One (2011) which was later adapted into a 2018 Hollywood film by Steven Spielberg,[27] Other examples of films with isekai elements include Tron (1982), Labyrinth (1986), Army of Darkness (1992), Super Mario Bros. (1993), Jumanji (1995), Space Jam (1996) , Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over (2003) and MirrorMask (2005).[28] Disney released two critically acclaimed isekai animated television series, Amphibia and The Owl House.[29] Isekai anime series[edit] In 2017, Goo Ranking conducted a poll in Japan asking people to name their favourite isekai anime of all time. The following were the top fifteen titles.[15] Spirited Away (2001) Pop in Q (2016) Sword Art Online (2012 debut) Magic Knight Rayearth (1994–1997) Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World (2016 debut) The Twelve Kingdoms (2002–2003) KonoSuba (2016–2017) World Trigger (2014 debut) Kyo Kara Maoh!
