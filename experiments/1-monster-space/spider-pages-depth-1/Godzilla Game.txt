Between two and four people could play. Each player controlled six spaceships. One player's spaceships were all green, another's were all yellow, another's were all orange, and another's were all magenta. Occasionally Godzilla would appear and eat one of the spaceships. The last player to have a spaceship left would be the winner. References[edit] API at BoardGameGeek v t e Godzilla Films Toho films Shōwa era Godzilla (1954) Godzilla, King of the Monsters!
