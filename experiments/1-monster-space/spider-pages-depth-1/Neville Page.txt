On the wall were all sorts of bits of color, and as you got closer suddenly your interest turned to revulsion because those pictures were like pictures of intestines and eyeballs and pieces of animals. What he was doing was having a biological, evolutionary basis for every aspect of the creature."[5] From July through August 2010, the Oceanside Museum of Art held an exhibition on Page.[6] Titled: "From Page to Screen: Character and Creature Design of Neville Page", featuring works by Page, including pencil drawings, three-dimensional models, and digital creations.[7] Page said he hoped the exhibit would educate the public about a different facet to filmmaking, "The general public tends to associate films with actors versus people who conceive and design and make the films. What is on display is one small facet of what it takes to make a movie, one of the many gears involved in the mechanism, neither more important nor less ... simply as important."[8] Neville has served as a judge on the SyFy television series Face Off.[9] He joined the judging panel on Face Off in season three, which launched in August 2012.[10][11] His fellow judges included Ve Neill and Glenn Hetrick.[12] Page returned for the fourth season in 2013.[13] In October 2012, Page returned to the Oceanside Museum of Art, with an exhibition titled, "The Beauty in the Beast: Crafting Creatures by Neville Page".[14] The exhibit which ran for ten weeks featured 45 works by Page from films, including Green Lantern, Prometheus, and TRON: Legacy.[14] He was the creature designer for the 2013 American science fiction action film Star Trek Into Darkness.[15] Reception[edit] In the 2011 book Star Wars vs. Star Trek: Could the Empire Kick the Federation's Ass? And Other Galaxy-Shaking Enigmas, author Matt Forbeck characterized Neville Page as a "creature guru".[16] Cloverfield director Matt Reeves spoke highly of his work with Page, "... he is a genius."[5] Reeves characterized Page's work on the "creature" in the film, "It developed in many different ways, and it came down to what Neville was doing, which was amazing."[5] The North County Times referred to him observing, "Page is one of the most recognizable artists in the entertainment industry for his iconic designs."[6] Director of exhibitions and collections at the Oceanside Museum of Art, Teri Sowell, reflected of the exhibition featuring Page's work to The San Diego Union-Tribune, "These creatures are so embedded in our minds, we take them for granted. It's really handcrafted art."[8] Film director J. J. Abrams commented on Page's work on his film Super 8, "the designer of the creature, Neville Page, did an amazing job and I think he gave us something that took a ton of iterations but he really nailed it".[17] Filmography[edit] Film[edit] Year Film Role Director 2000 Men in Black: Alien Attack Creature design David C.
