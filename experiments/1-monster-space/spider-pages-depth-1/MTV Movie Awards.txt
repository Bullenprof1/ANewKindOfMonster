MTV Movie & TV Awards This is a picture of the "golden popcorn" awarded at the 2012 MTV Movie Awards. Awarded for Popularity in film and television Country  United States Presented by MTV First awarded June 10, 1992; 28 years ago (1992-06-10) Website www.mtv.com/​movie-and-tv-awards The MTV Movie & TV Awards (formerly known as the MTV Movie Awards)[1] is a film and television awards show presented annually on MTV. The nominees are decided by producers and executives at MTV. Winners are decided online by the general public. Presently, voting is done through MTV's official website through a Movie & TV Awards voting website.[2] The 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards took place on May 7, 2017, and featured the first time men and women competed jointly in the acting categories.[1] Winners are presented with the "golden popcorn" statue made by New-York-firm Society Awards.[3] The awards have traditionally been tied to the start of the summer blockbuster season for the film industry, and with the launch of television awards, to the opening of that industry's awards season.

This meant that the ceremony was recorded out of order with the host segments recorded all at the start, followed by the musical performances and then award presentations, where those artists and actors nominated could choose to stay only for their award category and then depart after, with a seat filler filling their seat before or afterwards. After 2006, when Survivor producer Mark Burnett (who took over duties from Joel Gallen for the 2007 awards) took over production duties,[4] it began to be broadcast live most years, though since 2017, it has been recorded to air on a one or two-day delay, but broadcast live-to-tape. Since 2007, polls for several awards have been voted on through MTV's web and social media presences. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no word about the 2020 awards, either regarding the nominations or a date for the ceremony. Internally, the network had discussed a permanent move of the ceremony to December, which would place it in the early portion of awards season before the Golden Globe Awards.[5] On December 6, 2020, MTV aired a one-off special hosted by Vanessa Hudgens, MTV Movie & TV Awards: Greatest of All Time, which highlighted the greatest moments of film and television since the 1980s, as well as moments from past editions of the ceremony. The network stated a goal for a larger, weekend-long ceremony in 2021.[6] MTV announced on March 11, 2021 that the 2021 MTV Movie & TV Awards would be held on May 16 and 17, 2021; the second night of the ceremony will be entitled MTV Movie & TV Awards: Unscripted, and focus exclusively on reality television.[7] Award categories[edit] Best Movie (1992–present) Best Show (2017–present) Best Performance in a Movie (1992–present) Best Performance in a Show (2017–present) Best Comedic Performance (1992–present) Best Scared-As-Shit Performance (2005–2006, 2013–2015; known as "Best Frightened Performance" from 2010–2011 and again since 2018) Best Villain (1992–present; known as "Best On-Screen Dirt Bag" in 2012) Best Hero (2006, 2010–present; known as "Biggest Bad-Ass Star" in 2010–2011) Best Kiss (1992–present) Best Fight (1996–present) Best On-Screen Team (2017–present) Best Reality Series (2017–present; known as "Best Reality Competition" in 2017) Best Music Documentary (2018) Best Scene Stealer (2018) Retired awards[edit] Most Desirable Male (1992–1996) Most Desirable Female (1992–1996) Best New Filmmaker (1992–2002) Best Action Sequence (1992–2005) Best On-Screen Duo (1992–2006, 2013–2015) Best Musical Sequence (1992–2002, 2005, 2009, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017) Best Breakthrough Performance (1992–2017; known as "Breakout Star" in 2011–2012 and "Next Generation" in 2017) Best Dance Sequence (1995, 1998, 2001, 2004) Best Sandwich in a Movie (1996) Best Dressed (2001–2002) Best Virtual Performance (2003, 2016) Best Video Game Based on a Movie (2005) Sexiest Performance (2006) Best Summer Movie You Haven't Seen Yet (2007) Best Summer Movie So Far (2008) Best WTF Moment (2009–2011; known as "Best Jaw Dropping Moment" in 2011) Global Superstar (2010) Biggest Badass Star (2010–2011) Best Line from a Movie (2011) Best Cast (2012, 2016; known as "Ensemble Cast" in 2016) Best Gut-Wrenching Performance (2012–2015) Best On-Screen Transformation (2013–2014) Best Shirtless Performance (2013–2015) Favorite Character (2014) Best Action Performance (2016) Best Documentary (2016–2017) Ensemble Cast (2016) True Story (2016) Tearjerker (2017) Trending (2017) Best American Story (2017) Special awards[edit] Lifetime Achievement Award[edit] The Lifetime Achievement Award was given to movie personalities, including fictional characters, who made an impact on popular culture. Prior to announcing the winner MTV would air testimonials from major Hollywood celebrities praising the winners greatness while only offering a slight tease as to who the winner was. The producers of the award show intended the Lifetime Achievement Award to be a bit of fun and never intended it to be taken seriously -- as evident by the fact that fictional characters such as Jason Voorhees and Chewbacca were both winners. In 1998, the award was presented to Clint Howard who -- despite having a long and successful career as a character actor -- had never won any sort of award for his work up to that time. When presented with the award, Howard -- who had never been told that the award was essentially a joke and who felt genuinely honored -- gave a surprisingly heartfelt and emotional speech that made it clear he (Howard) was taking the award much, much more seriously than the producers intended. The producers decided to discontinue the Lifetime Achievement Award, feeling that after Howard's reaction, there was no way they could return to giving it out as a joke without humiliating the actor. 1992: Jason Voorhees 1993: The Three Stooges 1994: John Shaft 1995: Jackie Chan 1996: Godzilla 1997: Chewbacca 1998: Clint Howard Silver Bucket of Excellence[edit] The Silver Bucket of Excellence is an award that was given to a film that has made lasting impact on moviegoers and the MTV audience.[8] It was further defined in 2006 as honoring a "film of the past that resonates with even more meaning today."[9] 2005: The Breakfast Club – awarded to Anthony Michael Hall, Molly Ringwald, and Ally Sheedy 2006: Do the Right Thing – awarded to Spike Lee Generation Award[edit] The MTV Generation Award is the successor to the MTV Lifetime Achievement Award, though it is more serious than its predecessor. The recipient of the award is celebrated for great achievement in movies. The distinction "is given to an artist who has shown us a variety of impressive roles, a personal and professional flair and of course, an awesome level of talent."[10] 2005: Tom Cruise 2006: Jim Carrey 2007: Mike Myers 2008: Adam Sandler 2009: Ben Stiller 2010: Sandra Bullock 2011: Reese Witherspoon 2012: Johnny Depp 2013: Jamie Foxx 2014: Mark Wahlberg 2015: Robert Downey, Jr. 2016: Will Smith[11] 2017: The Fast and the Furious franchise 2018: Chris Pratt 2019: Dwayne Johnson Trailblazer Award[edit] The MTV Trailblazer Award recipient spearheads the way for others that work in the movie industry.

This may include sound and video montages, replacing some of the original cast with other actors (commonly, the hosts of each year's show) generally mocking the scenes of that film. The diversity of the spoofs can vary greatly, from one dialogue (such as in 2005) to several long scenes, including fighting and action sequences (2003).
