The Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) fantasy role-playing game has spawned many related products, including magazines, films and video games.

At the time, role-playing games were still seen as a subgenre of the wargaming industry, and the magazine was designed not only to support D&D and TSR's other games, but also to cover wargaming in general. In short order, however, the popularity and growth of D&D made it clear that the game had not only separated itself from its wargaming origins, but had launched an entirely new industry unto itself. The following year, after only seven issues, TSR cancelled The Strategic Review and replaced it in 1976 with The Dragon (later Dragon Magazine). Although Dragon Magazine was originally designed to support the role-playing industry in general, it has always been primarily a house organ for TSR's games with a particular focus on D&D. Most of the magazine's articles provide supplementary material for the game, including new races, classes, spells, traps, monsters, skills, and rules. Other articles will provide tips and suggestions for players and DMs. The magazine has also published a number of well-known, gamer-oriented comic strips over the years, including Wormy, SnarfQuest, Yamara, Knights of the Dinner Table, Nodwick, Dork Tower, and The Order of the Stick. Between 1983 and 1985, TSR's UK branch published Imagine Magazine. It featured similar content to Dragon, focusing on D&D and Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D). Imagine featured a monthly series of articles about a new campaign world, Pelinore, which were later continued in the non-TSR magazine Game Master. Some material that originated in Imagine was eventually incorporated into Unearthed Arcana. In 1986, TSR launched a new magazine to complement Dragon. Dungeon Adventures, published bimonthly, published nothing but adventure modules for Dungeon Masters. While Dungeon now publishes other kinds of material as well, Dungeons & Dragons adventures remain its main focus. While many other magazines have partially or fully devoted themselves to supporting D&D, Dragon and Dungeon remain the only two official publications for the game. In 2002, Wizards of the Coast licensed the two magazines to Paizo Publishing. Publication of both magazines then ceased in September 2007 as the owning company opted for an online model, citing a downturn in the market for low-circulation specialty and hobby magazines.[citation needed] In total, there were 359 Dragon issues and 150 Dungeon issues released in print.[1] The final 3rd Edition issue of Dragon was #362, and the final 3rd Edition issue of Dungeon was #153. The online version of the magazines are up to issue 408 and 201 respectively as of April 2012. Films and TV[edit] A popular D&D animated television series was produced in 1983. The cartoon was based upon the concept of a small group of young adults and children who get transported to a D&D-based fantasy realm by riding a magical roller coaster. When they arrive, they are given potent magical weapons and must survive against the chromatic dragon Tiamat and a power-hungry nemesis called Venger. They are assisted in each episode by a gnome-like creature called Dungeon Master and a baby unicorn named Uni.[2] A D&D movie was released in 2000 to largely negative critical reception.[3] Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God, a made-for-TV sequel, was first aired on the Sci-Fi Channel on October 8, 2005, receiving better critical reception, and was released on February 7, 2006 on DVD.[4] This sequel is also known by the alternate title Dungeons & Dragons 2: The Elemental Might.[5] A third film was also shot in 2011, Dungeons & Dragons: The Book of Vile Darkness. Warner Bros. has acquired rights to make a film based on Dungeons & Dragons, using a script written by David Leslie Johnson and will be produced by Roy Lee and Courtney Solomon.[6] However, Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast had sued Sweetpea Entertainment, producer of the first three D&D movies, over its movie deal with Warner claiming that the movie rights (TV and feature) have expired.[7] In 2015, Warner Brothers announced they had reached a settlement with Hasbro's Allspark Pictures and Sweetpea Entertainment over rights and a new movie was in the works.[8] As a result of the settlement, Hasbro transferred rights to Paramount Pictures by 2017.[9][10] Chris McKay was originally brought on in February 2018 to direct the film,[11] but was replaced by Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley in July 2019.[12] Chris Pine was in talks to star in the film in December 2020.[13] In 2003, a computer animated motion picture entitled Scourge of Worlds: A Dungeons & Dragons Adventure was produced for DVD, featuring the iconic characters (Regdar, Mialee, and Lidda) created for the 3rd Edition. This is an interactive movie that asks viewers to decide what actions the heroes should take at crucial points in the story, allowing hundreds of different story-telling combinations. A special edition was released later that included even more choices, two additional endings, the making of the Scourge of Worlds, and the original (linear) version of film. The official Dragonlance Chronicles animated movie, Dragonlance: Dragons of Autumn Twilight was released straight to video in January 2008. The film stars the voices of Michael Rosenbaum as Tanis, Kiefer Sutherland as Raistlin, Lucy Lawless as Goldmoon, and Michelle Trachtenberg as Tika.[citation needed] Computer and video games[edit] Main article: List of Dungeons & Dragons video games Many unique digital games had been released and sold under the D&D license. A significant number of these games were published by Strategic Simulations, Inc. (SSI). Most, but not all, are role-playing video games that use rules derived from some version of the D&D rules. Many of the games were released on multiple platforms, including personal computers, consoles, and handheld devices (including mobile phones). Notable titles include: Title Year Description Dungeons & Dragons Computer Labyrinth Game 1980 The first D&D game marketed for public consumption that contained digital electronics. This is a board game/video game hybrid, with a D&D table-top look-and-feel. Dungeon walls, monsters, and traps manifest themselves as series of beeps from the internal computer. Dungeons & Dragons Computer Fantasy Game 1981 A small (2" x 3" x .5") electronic game using the mechanics of Hunt the Wumpus. It used an LCD screen and various sound effects to inform the player of different in-game circumstances, such as proximity to pits, bats, the magic arrow or the dragon. Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Cartridge 1982 Designed for the Intellivision, the first video game based licensed under the D&D license. Pool of Radiance 1988 The first D&D video game. Designed by SSI, the same game engine would be used to develop ten more D&D games, the Gold Box series. It was "remade" by Ubisoft in 2001 under the name Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor. Eye of the Beholder 1990 The first in a trilogy of popular games designed by Westwood Studios and published by SSI in the early 1990s. Neverwinter Nights 1991 to 1997 Developed by Stormfront Studios and was one of the first graphical MMORPG, paving the way for other games including Ultima Online and EverQuest. The game was a major hit, and the name and settings formed the basis for the Neverwinter Nights video game (see below). Tower of Doom 1993 Two beat 'em up/action RPG hybrid series by Capcom. Shadow over Mystara 1996 Birthright: The Gorgon's Alliance 1996 Developed by Synergistic Software, a subsidiary of Sierra Entertainment and was an innovative mix of strategy and role-playing gaming, and featured realistic (for the time) 3D graphics. Unfortunately, the game was not a major success due to the decreased popularity of D&D inspired games at that time. Baldur's Gate 1998 From Interplay Entertainment, was developed by BioWare and was the first D&D video game to use BioWare's Infinity Engine. It met with critical success and was followed by several more D&D games from BioWare, including an expansion pack, Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast, and sequel, Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn, and its expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal. Baldur's Gate III was announced on June 6, 2019 to be released for Googleâ€™s Stadia and PC during the November 2019 launch window. It is being developed at Larian Studios. Planescape: Torment. Icewind Dale and Icewind Dale II 1999 to 2017 Developed by Interplay's Black Isle Studios and also used the BioWare Infinity Engine. The enhanced editions of the games are remade by Beamdog. Neverwinter Nights 2002 This game from BioWare included the Aurora toolset that allows users to create custom modules. Several expansion modules were sold by the distributor. Neverwinter Nights 2 2006 Dungeons & Dragons: Daggerdale 2011 Developed by Bedlam Games and published by Atari, set to release as a downloadable game for PSN/XBLA Sword Coast Legends 2015 Developed by n-Space and published by Digital Extremes, released as a downloadable game for Windows, OS X, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Low Magic Age 2017 Developed and published by Low Magic Studio, released as a downloadable game for Windows. Novels[edit] Main article: Dungeons & Dragons (novels) Several hundred novels have been published based upon Dungeons & Dragons. Fantasy Grand Master Andre Norton's novel Quag Keep, published in 1979, was set in Greyhawk, making it the first novel to use a D&D campaign setting. Throughout the early 1980s, TSR printed several series of gamebooks of varying complexity under series titles such as Endless Quest, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Adventure Gamebooks, HeartQuest, and 1 on 1 Adventure Gamebooks. Most of these books were based on D&D, although some were based on other TSR role-playing games. The Dragonlance product line, begun in 1984, was the first series of novels produced by TSR and has since seen more than 190 titles published. D&D creator Gary Gygax's series of Gord the Rogue novels, published from 1985 to 1988, was set in his Greyhawk campaign setting. A number of other novels have also been set in Greyhawk. Numerous novels have been set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting by such authors as R. A. Salvatore and setting creator Ed Greenwood. A number of books have also been published under the generic Dungeons & Dragons heading. They are as follows: 2nd Edition novels[edit] Tale of the Comet (July 1997), by Roland J.

After the release of the 3rd Edition, KenzerCo, better known for the popular gaming comic Knights of the Dinner Table, secured the licensing rights to produce official D&D comics. Using the license, they produced a number of different mini-series. One notable mini-series for this comic line entitled Tempest's Gate was authored by Sean Smith. It featured memorable iconic characters of D&D such as Zed Kraken, a powerful and influential magus.[15] In 2002, Iron Hammer Graphics published the single-issue comic Vecna: Hand of the Revenent. In 2005, the license passed to Devil's Due Productions. Starting in June of that year, Devil's Due began releasing official adaptations of D&D tie-in novels, starting with Salvatore's Dark Elf Trilogy. As webcomics grew, many were created around the idea of D&D, some of them even going as far as publishing actual books. Amongst the more popular ones are Rich Burlew's The Order of the Stick and Tarol Hunts's Goblins. The game has also been seen in several FoxTrot comic strips over the years played by Jason and his best friend Marcus. In 2010, IDW Publishing started publishing an ongoing Dungeons & Dragons comic based on the 4th Edition core setting which finished in February 2012.[16] In 2011, they also released a limited series based on the Dark Sun campaign setting, as well as another series, Forgotten Realms: The Legend of Drizzt: Neverwinter Tales, written by R.A. Salvatore and based on his famous D&D character, Drizzt Do'Urden.[16] Since 2014, IDW Publishing have published several mini-series based on the 5th Edition core setting: Legends of Baldur's Gate (2014), Shadows of the Vampire (2016), Frost Giantâ€™s Fury (2017), Evil at Baldurâ€™s Gate (2018), A Darkened Wish (2019),[17] Infernal Tide (2019),[18] A Darkened Wish (2019),[19] and At the Spine of the World (2020).[20] On August 29, 2018, a crossover comic with the adult animated sitcom Rick and Morty was published by IDW and Oni Press. The series titled Rick and Morty vs. Dungeons & Dragons is co-written by Jim Zub and Patrick Rothfuss, and drawn by Troy Little.[21] A four-issue sequel, Rick and Morty vs. Dungeons & Dragons: Chapter II: Painscape, written by Jim Zub and Sarah Stern with art by Troy Little was published in 2019.[22] A five-issue crossover comic with the Netflix television series Stranger Things was published by IDW and Dark Horse Comics on November 4, 2020.[23] Board games[edit] Several board games have been sold either under the Dungeons & Dragons trademark or in association with it: Dungeon! (1975), a board game published by TSR, featured similar gameplay and genre tropes to D&D and was frequently advertised in D&D products. Dungeons & Dragons Computer Labyrinth Game (1980), the first computer/board game hybrid and the first D&D licensed game that contained digital electronics.

Three expansions were released for it: Dragon's Den, Haunted Tower, and Goblin's Lair. Dragon Quest (1992) The Classic Dungeon (1992) DragonStrike (1993) used a simplified form of D&D and included an instructional video tape in which costumed actors, combined with computer-generated imagery, played the characters and monsters from the board game. First Quest (1994) was the name of the AD&D game that first featured an audio CD which included instructions and two quests that coincide with two of the four adventures in the included Adventure Book. Clue Dungeons & Dragons (2001) Standard Clue with a D&D fantasy theme and optional wandering monsters.[24] Dungeons & Dragons: The Fantasy Adventure Board Game (2002) Cooperative dungeon crawl game in which a party of four heroes strives to complete adventures that the Dungeon Master puts before them (In the Style of HeroQuest).
