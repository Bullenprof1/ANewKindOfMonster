(April 2018) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Goddess in Greek mythology Pepromene /pɪˈprɒmɪniː/ is a goddess and being of fate/destiny in Greek mythology (a being of "the destined share", which implies a person's true calling and fate; in short, the idea that every man is tied to a destiny). The ancient perception of her being gives the name as belonging within other Greek ideas (or "seeings") for destiny and fate (such as Aesa, Moira, Moros, Ananke, Adrasteia and Heimarmene).[1][2] Etymology[edit] Pepromene's name is speculated to have numerous different origins; some postulate it is derived from the Greek πεπρῶσθαι, peprosthai, meaning "to be furnished, fulfilled or fated". However, others suggest that the same πεπερατοσθαι (pepratosthai) means "finite", implying finite nature; the fact that nothing in this life lasts forever.
