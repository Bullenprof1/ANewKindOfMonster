Information[edit] In a surviving fragment of Solon's poems, a contrast is made to Eunomia, a name elsewhere given to one of the Horae, the embodiments of order. Both were figures of rhetoric and poetry; neither figured in myth or Greek religious cult — although other personifications did, like Harmonia, "Agreement";[2] whether Harmonia is only a personification is debatable.[3] In 2005, Dysnomia was chosen as the name for the moon of the dwarf planet Eris.[4] Notes[edit] ^ Hesiod, Theogony 225ff. ^ OCD s.
