Award presented in recognition of the worst in film "Golden Raspberry" redirects here. For the fruit, see Raspberry. Golden Raspberry Award Current: 41st Golden Raspberry Awards The Golden Raspberry Award statuette Awarded for Worst in film Country United States Presented by Golden Raspberry Award Foundation First awarded March 31, 1981; 39 years ago Website razzies.com The Golden Raspberry Awards (also known in short terms as Razzies and Razzie Awards) is a parody award show honoring the worst of cinematic under-achievements. Co-founded by UCLA film graduates and film industry veterans John J. B. Wilson and Mo Murphy, the Razzie Awards' satirical annual ceremony has preceded its polar opposite, the coveted Academy Awards, for four decades. The term raspberry is used in its irreverent sense, as in "blowing a raspberry". The statuette itself is a golf ball-sized raspberry atop a mangled Super 8mm film reel spray-painted gold, with an estimated street value of $4.97. The Golden Raspberry Foundation have claimed that the award "encourages well-known filmmakers and top notch performers to own their bad." The first Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony was held on March 31, 1981, in John J. B. Wilson's living-room alcove in Hollywood, to honor the perceived worst films of the 1980 film season. To this day, Sylvester Stallone is the most awarded actor ever with 10 awards won while Madonna is the most awarded actress with 9 awards.[1] Contents 1 History 2 Format 3 Recipients who have accepted their award 4 Contenders for worst and best 4.1 Razzie and Oscar 4.2 Razzie and Annie Award 4.3 Razzie and Golden Globe 4.4 Razzie and Grammy 4.5 Razzie and Saturn Award 4.6 Razzie and international awards 5 Categories 5.1 Special categories 5.1.1 Anniversary Awards 6 Other types of awards 6.1 The Razzie Redeemer Award 6.2 Worst Career Achievement 6.3 Governor's Award 6.4 Barry L.

Wilson traditionally held potluck parties at his home in Hollywood on the night of the Academy Awards.[2] In 1981, after the 53rd Academy Awards had completed for the evening, Wilson invited friends to give random award presentations in his living room.[2][3] Wilson decided to hold the event, after seeing a 99-cent double feature of Can't Stop the Music and Xanadu.[4] He gave attendees ballots to vote on the worst.[4] Wilson stood at a podium made of cardboard in a tacky tuxedo, with a foam ball attached to a broomstick as a fake microphone, and announced Can't Stop the Music as the first Golden Raspberry Award Winner for Worst Picture.[4][5] The impromptu ceremony was a success and the following week a press release about his event was picked up by a few local newspapers, including a mention in the Los Angeles Daily News with the headline: "Take These Envelopes, Please".[2][3][5] Approximately three dozen people came to the 1st Golden Raspberry Awards.[5] The 2nd Golden Raspberry Awards had double the attendance, and the 3rd awards ceremony had doubled that number.[5] By the 4th Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony, CNN and two major wire services covered the event.[2] "We finally figured out you couldn't compete with the Oscars on Oscar night, but if you went the night before, when the press from all over the world are here and they are looking for something to do, it could well catch on," Wilson told BBC News.[2] Format[edit] Members of the Golden Raspberry Award Organization (composed of filmmakers and very opinionated film buffs from around the world) vote to determine the recipients.[6] Voting members hail from all 50 U.S. states and every continent with the exception of Antarctica. Worst Supporting Actress at the 29th Golden Raspberry Awards. The ceremony is modeled after the Academy Awards but done with deliberate intent to be low-end and tacky.[citation needed] Recipients who have accepted their award[edit] Main article: List of people who have accepted Golden Raspberry Awards Recipients who have accepted their Golden Raspberry Award include Tom Green (Worst Actor/Worst Director), Halle Berry[7][8] and Sandra Bullock (Worst Actress), Michael Ferris, J. D. Shapiro (Worst Screenplay), Paul Verhoeven (Worst Director), eight-time Oscar Winner Alan Menken, Dinesh D'Souza, Fifty Shades of Grey producers Dana Brunetti and Michael De Luca, and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. Contenders for worst and best[edit] Several people have gotten Razzie nominations for being the worst at something while at the same time, they got nominations from other organisations for being the best. Razzie and Oscar[edit] Three people won both the Razzies and Oscars the same weekend: Alan Menken in 1993, Brian Helgeland in 1997, and Sandra Bullock in 2010, although each of the three won for two different films in the same year (for example, Helgeland won both a Razzie and an Oscar for The Postman and L.A. Confidential, respectively).[9][10] Three actors had performances in the same movie netting them both Oscar and Razzie nominations, James Coco (Only When I Laugh), Amy Irving (Yentl) and Glenn Close (Hillbilly Elegy).[11] The Aerosmith song "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing", as part of the original soundtrack to the 1998 film Armageddon, was nominated for both an Academy Award for Best Original Song[12] and a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song, as was the Trisha Yearwood song "How Do I Live" from the 1997 film Con Air[13] and the Tony Bennett song "Life in a Looking Glass" from the 1986 film That's Life!.[14] Gena Rowlands was nominated in the Academy Award for Best Actress category for her role in the 1980 John Cassavetes film Gloria[15] while her co-star John Adames won the Worst Supporting Actor alongside co-winner Laurence Olivier in a remake of the 1927 film The Jazz Singer. Wall Street (1987) is the only film to date to win both an Oscar and a Razzie. Michael Douglas won the Academy Award for Best Actor,[16][17] while Daryl Hannah's performance earned her a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actress. Disney's The Lone Ranger may have won one (Worst Remake) of its five nominations, but it was also nominated for two Oscars (for Best Makeup and Hairstyling and Best Visual Effects).[18] The 1983 romance/dance film Flashdance was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Screenplay, but won one of its three Oscar nominations for Best Original Song for Irene Cara's "Flashdance... What a Feeling".[19] While 1992's The Bodyguard was a critical failure (earning seven Razzie nominations), it was a huge box office hit and, moreover, its multi-platinum soundtrack album overshadowed the film that it garnered two nominations for Best Original Song.[20] Joker (2019) was the most nominated film at the 92nd Academy Awards, having scored 11 nominations including the Academy Award for Best Picture,[21] and won two including the Academy Award for Best Actor.[22] However, the film's polarized critical reception resulted in it earning a nomination in the special Razzie Category Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property, which it lost to Rambo: Last Blood.[23] This nomination also made Joker the second film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and a Razzie, after 1990's The Godfather Part III. Borat Subsequent Moviefilm was nominated for two Academy Awards at the 93rd Academy Awards for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress for Maria Bakalova [24][25][26] in the same year it was nominated for two Razzies at the 41st Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst Supporting Actor for Rudy Giuliani and Worst Screen Combo for Giuliani and Bakalova.[27][28] Razzie and Annie Award[edit] In spite of the heavily negative critical consensus (winning only one of its six nominations), the 2012 action film Battleship was also nominated for an Annie Award for Best Animated Effects in a Live Action Production.[29] Despite receiving the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, voice actor Ahmed Best won an Annie Award in 2009 for the portrayal of the same character in the animated TV episode Robot Chicken: Star Wars Episode II.[30] Razzie and Golden Globe[edit] Neil Diamond, winner of the inaugural Worst Actor Razzie for 1980's The Jazz Singer, was nominated for the Golden Globe in the same role.[31] 1988's Cocktail won two of its four nominations for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay, but the Beach Boys's song "Kokomo" was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song.[32] Despite being a major critical and commercial disappointment, and only receiving the most awards and nominations (including Worst Picture and Worst Director (Tom Hooper)), the 2019 film Cats was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song for Taylor Swift's song "Beautiful Ghosts".[33] The controversial Sia-directed autism musical Music, nominated for four Razzies, was also nominated for two Golden Globes; Best Actress (Kate Hudson) and Best Picture, both for Musical or Comedy.[34][35][36] Razzie and Grammy[edit] Various songs received wins/nominations for both the Razzie and the Grammy Awards, such as Madonna's "Die Another Day" (Best Dance Recording),[37] Will Smith's "Wild Wild West" (Best Rap Solo Performance),[38] Britney Spears' "Overprotected" (Best Female Pop Vocal Performance),[39] U2's "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me" (Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal),[40] The Smashing Pumpkins' "The End Is the Beginning Is the End" (Best Hard Rock Performance),[41] and LeAnn Rimes' "How Do I Live" (Best Female Country Vocal Performance).[42] Razzie and Saturn Award[edit] In 1981, Stanley Kubrick was nominated both for a Razzie Award as Worst Director at the 1st Golden Raspberry Awards[43] as well as for a Saturn Award for Best Director at the 8th Saturn Awards[44] for the same film: The Shining. In 2002, Natalie Portman was nominated for Worst Supporting Actress and for the Saturn Award for Best Actress for the same role in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones.[45] Cassandra Peterson was nominated for Worst Actress at the 9th Golden Raspberry Awards and for Best Actress at the 16th Saturn Awards for her role as Elvira in the 1988 film Elvira: Mistress of the Dark. In 2001, whilst Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes garnered all three Razzies it was nominated for, Rick Baker's makeup designs were very well received, that it earned him a Saturn Award nomination for Best Makeup, while Helena Bonham Carter, Tim Roth and Colleen Atwood were respectively nominated for Best Supporting Actress, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Costume. The 1997 apocalyptic film The Postman "received" all five awards, but also three Saturn nominations.[46] Razzie and international awards[edit] In 1985, Michael Cimino's Year of the Dragon, which was nominated for five Razzie Awards (including Worst Picture) at the 6th Golden Raspberry Awards, was also nominated for the César Award for Best Foreign Film (César du meilleur film étranger) and was listed by the prestigious French magazine Cahiers du Cinéma as the third best film of 1985.[47][48][49] In 2017, Darren Aronofsky, director of Mother!, was nominated for both the Worst Director Razzie at the 38th Golden Raspberry Awards and the Golden Lion at the 74th Venice International Film Festival.[50][51] In 2018, the mystery comedy Holmes & Watson won four of its six nominations (including Worst Picture and Worst Director (Etan Cohen)) at the 39th Golden Raspberry Awards, but was also nominated for two ALFS Awards (including British Actor (Steve Coogan) and Young British Performer (Noah Jupe)). Despite Johnny Depp receiving two Razzie nominations for his performance in the film, Emily Blunt received an ALFS Award nomination for her performance in the CGI-animated box office hit Sherlock Gnomes. She also received nominations for her parts in the critically acclaimed movies A Quiet Place and Mary Poppins Returns.[52] While M. Night Shyamalan's After Earth tied Movie 43 for the most awards with three, it also brought its composer James Newton Howard a World Soundtrack Award nomination for Film Composer of the Year.

The Razzies, properly enough, avoid pouncing on the little guy; they don't trash no-budget indies no one has seen for having bad lighting or terrible sound".[61] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph has said "the Razzies' ongoing failure to train its sights on anything but the most obvious targets means it grows more tired and redundant by the year".[62] CraveOnline's William Bibbiani stated that the Razzies follow "a cheap shot of pranksterism", and "with only a handful of exceptions, only seen fit to nominate the most infamous movies of the year, and not necessarily the worst."[64] See also[edit] Film portal Academy Awards Stinkers Bad Movie Awards The Golden Turkey Awards Golden Kela Awards List of films considered the worst List of people who have accepted Golden Raspberry Awards References[edit] ^ "All-Time RAZZIE Cham-Peens LIST - The Official RAZZIE® Forum". 2012-02-21.
