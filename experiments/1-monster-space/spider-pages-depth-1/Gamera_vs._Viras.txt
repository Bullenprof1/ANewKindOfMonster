Gamera intervenes and destroys it; but before the ship is destroyed, the aliens broadcast a warning to their world, stating that Gamera is their enemy. Later on Earth, a Boy Scout troop is visiting an aquarium to see the scientists working on a small two-man submarine. Masao and Jim, two of the scouts, manage to talk their way aboard the sub. While in the water they spot Gamera, who engages in a little race with the boys. However, their hijinks come to an end when the second alien vessel envelops the both of them in a super-catch ray. Gamera helps the boys to escape, but he remains trapped in the force field while the aliens scan his memories. They learn of Gamera's one weakness, his soft spot for children. Soon after, the field weakens and Gamera is free. The aliens capture Jim and Masao, threatening to kill the boys. Powerless to help them, Gamera lands. Attaching a mind control control device to Gamera's head, the aliens force the turtle kaiju to do their bidding. While aboard the spaceship, the boys continually try to escape. Gamera, however (under the influence of the aliens), is destroying dams and cities by the handful. Jim and Masao discover a squid-like creature, thinking that he is another captive of the aliens. In fact, he is the leader of the aliens. The boys help Gamera break free from the mind control device and succed escapes from the spaceship. Next Gamera attack the spaceship. Grounded by Gamera, the aliens reveal that their human forms were just disguises. The aliens all merge to form the giant monster Viras. Gamera and Viras duke it out in a big beachside battle. Gamera manages to pull Viras into the upper atmosphere, freezing him to death. He then flings Viras' body back into the ocean. The boys and a crowd of adults celebrate Gamera's victory. Cast[edit] Kōjirō Hongō as Nobuhiko Shimada Tōru Takatsuka as Masao Nakaya Carl Craig as Jim Morgan Michiko Yaegaki as Mariko Nakaya Mari Atsumi as Junko Aoki Junko Yashiro as Masako Shibata Kōji Fujiyama as the Commander of Jietat Genzō Wakayama as the voice of Viras ("Boss") Teruo Aragaki as Gamera Production[edit] Gamera vs. Viras was filmed at Daiei-Tokyo Studios.[1] The film is the fourth in the Gamera film series.[1] Daiei was in "financial trouble" at the beginning of 1968 and as a result cut the film's budget to ¥20 million, about $56,000 at the time. Footage from previous Gamera films was re-used in some parts of the movie. The film was shot in 25 days.[2] The agreement between Daiei and AI-TV stipulated that an American boy be cast as one of the two main child characters. No American child actors who spoke Japanese could be found at the time of production, so "Carl Craig, the child of a U.S. Army man stationed in Japan" was cast, even though he had no acting experience."[2] Release[edit] Gamera vs. Viras was released in Japan on 20 March 1968.[1] It was "such a big success in Japan" that the studio asked director Yuasu if he could produce two additional Gamera films per year. Although Yuasu said that that was impossible, it opened the door to additional Gamera films being made.[2] The film was never released theatrically in the United States.[1] It was released directly to television by American International Television in 1969 as Destroy All Planets.[1] Reception[edit] In a retrospective review, AllMovie stated that the film offers "everything one expects from a massive zero-budget monster battle film" while also having "unintentionally brilliant quirky moments like the hypnotized army, Japanese men with glowing eyeballs, and a fiendishly fake-looking squid alien who wishes to attack Earth for its supply of nitrogen."[3] Phil Hardy, the British film critic, calls the move "a straightforward children's film" and that it "continues the shift of the monster genre towards a space opera context," which diminishes "the thematic interest of the genre."[4] American writer John LeMay said that "in terms of character utilization and script, Gamera vs. Viras could be the film where it all came together. But, in terms of budget and [special effects], it was the film where it all started to fall apart."[2] References[edit] Footnotes[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m Galbraith IV 1996, p. 150. sfn error: no target: CITEREFGalbraith_IV1996 (help) ^ a b c d LeMay, John (2017).
