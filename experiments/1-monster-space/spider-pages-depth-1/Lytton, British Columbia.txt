The location has been inhabited by the Nlaka'pamux people for over 10,000 years.[citation needed] It is one of the earliest locations settled by non-natives in the Southern Interior of British Columbia. It was founded during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858–59, when it was known as "The Forks". The community includes the Village of Lytton and the surrounding community of the Lytton First Nation, whose name for the place is Camchin, also spelled Kumsheen ("river meeting").

The same year, Lytton was named for Edward Bulwer-Lytton, the British Colonial Secretary and a novelist.[2] For many years Lytton was a stop on major transportation routes, namely, the River Trail from 1858, Cariboo Wagon Road in 1862, the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s, the Cariboo Highway in the 1920s, and the Trans Canada Highway in the 1950s. However, it has become much less important since the construction of the Coquihalla Highway in 1987 which uses a more direct route to the BC Interior. Name origin[edit] Novelist Bulwer-Lytton was a friend and contemporary of Charles Dickens and was one of the pioneers of the historical novel, exemplified by his most popular work, The Last Days of Pompeii. He is best remembered today for the opening line to the novel Paul Clifford, which begins "It was a dark and stormy night..." and is considered by some to be the worst opening sentence in the English language.[3] However, Bulwer-Lytton is also responsible for well-known sayings such as "The pen is mightier than the sword" from his play Richelieu. Despite being a very popular author for 19th-century readers, few people today are even aware of his prodigious body of literature spanning many genres. In the 21st century he is known best as the namesake for the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest (BLFC), sponsored annually by the English Department at San Jose State University, which challenges entrants "to compose the opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels". In 1858 Governor James Douglas named the town after Bulwer-Lytton "as a merited compliment and mark of respect". Bulwer-Lytton served as Colonial Secretary. As governor of the then colony, Douglas would have reported to him.[4]:158 Lord Lytton literary debate[edit] On August 30, 2008, the Village of Lytton invited Henry Lytton-Cobbold, the great-great-great grandson of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, to defend the great man's honour by debating Professor Scott Rice, the sponsor of the BLFC, on the literary and political legacies of his great ancestor.[5] The debate received wide media coverage including The Globe and Mail, The New York Times, The Guardian, CBC's As It Happens and many local and regional newspapers and radio and TV stations. The debate was moderated by Mike McArdell of Global TV. Lytton-Cobbold provided a spirited and crowd-inspiring defense of his ancestor, and despite a factual and well-researched presentation by Rice, Lytton-Cobbold emerged as the crowd favorite by a wide margin. In the end, Rice begrudgingly admitted to an admiration of Bulwer-Lytton. This event was held as part of the Village of Lytton's 150BC celebrations, as it was the 150th anniversary of the community receiving its name. Population[edit] The population of the village municipality as of the 2016 census was 249,[6] with another 1,700 in the immediate area living in rural areas and on reserves of the neighbouring six Nlaka'pamux communities.[which?] 802 members out of 1,970 registered members of the Lytton First Nation live on reserves immediately adjacent to the municipality.[7] Climate[edit] Lytton experiences either a dry-summer warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: Dsb bordering Dsa), or a warm-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csb bordering Csa). During summer heat waves, Lytton is often the hottest spot in Canada, despite being north of 50° in latitude. Due to the dry summer air and a relatively low elevation of 230 m (750 ft), summer afternoon shade temperatures sometimes reach 35 °C (95 °F) and up and occasionally top 40 °C (104 °F). Lytton, along with the nearby community of Lillooet, share the second-highest temperature ever recorded in Canada.[8] On July 16 and 17, 1941, the temperature reached a record 44.4 °C (112 °F) on both days in both communities.[9] Lytton also holds the record for the hottest temperature ever recorded in the province during August after the temperature reached 41.8 °C (107.2 °F) on August 14, 2004.[10] The coldest temperature ever recorded in Lytton was -31.7 °C (-25 °F) on 18 January 1950.[11] Hot summer temperatures are made more tolerable by low humidity. However, the heat can be intense with usually clear blue skies and blazing sunlight – heat also radiates from the valley's slopes, and forest fires are not uncommon during the summer. Lytton's climate is also characterized by relatively short and mild winters (although December and January average monthly temperatures are just below freezing), with Pacific maritime influence during the winter ensuring thick cloud cover much of the time. Cold snaps originating from arctic outflow occur from time to time, but tend to be short-lived, and mountains to the north block extreme cold from penetrating the Fraser Canyon. Lytton receives 430.6 mm (16.95 in)[12] of annual precipitation on average, making Lytton much drier than communities to the south, but certainly wetter than some of the driest spots in the BC interior such as Spences Bridge, Kamloops, and Osoyoos. However, Lytton has the driest summers in the interior of British Columbia, and indeed, one of the driest summers of all places in Canada. Maximum precipitation occurs in the cooler months, with the late autumn and early winter constituting the wettest time of the year.

Transportation[edit] Street sign in Lytton Lytton lies on the Trans Canada Highway as well as both the Canadian Pacific and Canadian National Railways. The Canadian National Railway Crosses both the Fraser and Thompson Rivers on two large steel bridges at Lytton. Via the Trans-Canada, Lytton is approximately 265 km from the city of Vancouver, 111 km north of Hope, and 84 km south of Cache Creek and Ashcroft. Highway 12 runs north from Lytton 62 km to Lillooet, connecting there to Highway 99, which leads southwest to Pemberton and Whistler and beyond to Vancouver, and northeast to its terminus at Lower Hat Creek (Carquile) at a junction with Highway 97 just north of Cache Creek. The Lytton Ferry, a free reaction ferry, crosses the Fraser River at Lytton. On the river's west side are Indian reserve communities of the Lytton First Nation and the Stein Valley Nlaka'pamux Heritage Park via trails from the confluence of the Stein River with the Fraser. From the ferry, a route known as the West Side Road leads through the Nesikep and Texas Creek areas to Lillooet and BC Highway 99; the route south from the ferry is much more difficult but leads to North Bend-Boston Bar. When the ferry is out of service due to ice or low water levels on the Fraser River, pedestrian access is available via a walkway on the Canadian National Railway bridge crossing the river. Via Rail's Canadian and the Rocky Mountaineer pass through Lytton, but do not make any stops. Via Rail's closest stops are Ashcroft, 80 km to the north, and North Bend/Boston Bar, 44 km to the south. Politics[edit] Municipal[edit] The mayor of Lytton is Jan Polderman, who was elected for the first time during the 2018 Municipal Election. Lytton is a corporate entity created under the Community Charter Act. The elections for the Village Council are held every three years. The current Council includes: Mayor Jan Polderman Councillor Ian Hay Councillor Tiffany Callewaert-Haugen Councillor Huntley Smith Provincial[edit] Originally part of the Lillooet provincial riding, then part of Yale-Lillooet Lytton is now in the provincial riding of Fraser-Nicola, represented by Jackie Tegart of the BC Liberals, who first won in the 2013 election. Federal[edit] Federally, the town is in the riding of Mission—Matsqui—Fraser Canyon and is currently represented by Jati Sidhu of the Liberals. Economy[edit] The single main employer in the Village was part of the forestry industry and was forced to close following the market uncertainties of 2007. Tourism is of ever increasing importance as Lytton is the self-proclaimed "River Rafting Capital of Canada". Biggest of the companies operating from Lytton is Kumsheen Rafting Resort. Hyak is very close behind and Fraser River and Reo Rafting are the smaller rafting companies. A provincial campsite, Skihist Provincial Park, is adjacent to the Trans-Canada Highway six kilometres north of the Village, with space for tenting as well as RVs and enjoys one of the few views available of Skihist Mountain, the highest summit of the Lillooet Ranges, across the Fraser to the west of Lytton. The privately run Jade Springs Restaurant, also east of the Village on the Trans-Canada, offers a full service campground.
