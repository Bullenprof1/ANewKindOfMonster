The field is usually composed of one or more tinctures (colours or metals) or furs. The field may be divided or may consist of a variegated pattern. In rare modern cases, the field or a subdivision thereof is not a tincture but is shown as a scene from a landscape,[1] or, in the case of the 329th Fighter Group of the United States Air Force, blazoned as the sky proper.[2] Landscape fields are regarded by many heralds as unheraldic and debased, as they defy the heraldic ideal of simple, boldly-coloured images, and they cannot be consistently drawn from blazon. The arms of the Inveraray and District Community Council in Scotland have as a field In waves of the sea. The correct language of heraldry is very flexible and virtually any image may be blazoned in a correct manner, for example "sky proper" might be blazoned simply Azure or bleu celeste, whilst "waves of the sea" might be blazoned correctly as Azure, 3 bars undee argent which would provide 3 wavy thick white lines on a blue field.
