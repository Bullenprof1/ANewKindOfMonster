Thomas de Kent or Thomas of Kent was a twelfth-century Anglo-Norman writer who wrote the Alexander romance Roman de toute chevalerie. The work derives from the Zacher Epitome of Julius Valerius Alexander Polemius,[1] but differs in certain respects. For example, it maps conquests by cardinal direction. This allows him to explain certain wonders in terms of a climate theory. Hercules is also invoked in comparison and the "exoticism" of the Orient is said to be rendered more excessively alluring and luxurious.[2] References[edit] ^ The Medieval Alexander.
