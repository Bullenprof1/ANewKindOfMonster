Chehalis is the site of Chehalis Indian Reserve No. 5 of the Sts'Ailes people and their government, the Chehalis First Nation.[1] The Chehalis River enters the Harrison near the reserve community, which is on IR No. 5. Chehalis Indian Reserve No. 6 is across the Harrison from the main community,[2] which is home to various non-native businesses as well as native-operated ones.
