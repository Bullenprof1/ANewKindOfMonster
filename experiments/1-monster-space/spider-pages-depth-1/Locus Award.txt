The Locus Awards are an annual set of literary awards voted on by readers of the science fiction and fantasy magazine Locus, a monthly based in Oakland, California. The awards are presented at an annual banquet. In addition to the plaques awarded to the winners, publishers of winning works are honored with certificates, which is unique in the field.[1] Originally a poll of Locus subscribers only, voting is now open to anyone, but the votes of subscribers count twice as much as the votes of non-subscribers.[2] The award was inaugurated in 1971 and was originally more of a list than an award, intended to provide suggestions and recommendations for the Hugo Awards.[1] Contents 1 Frequently nominated 2 Categories 3 Inactive categories 4 References 5 External links Frequently nominated[edit] As of the 2019 awards, the following have had the most nominations:[3] Person Nominations Nominations (fiction) Wins Robert Silverberg 158 88 9 Gardner Dozois 131 21 43 Ellen Datlow 100 0 14 Michael Swanwick 82 73 3 Ursula K.
