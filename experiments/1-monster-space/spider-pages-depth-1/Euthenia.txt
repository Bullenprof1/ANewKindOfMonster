Euthenia[pronunciation?] was the ancient Greek female spirit of prosperity. Her opposite was Penia and her sisters entailed Eucleia, Philophrosyne, and Eupheme. Along with her siblings, she was regarded as a member of the younger Charites. According to the Orphic fragments, her parents were Hephaestus and Aglaea.[1] Euthenia depicted in a garden. She is also a part of the Egyptian and Roman pantheon. During Ptolemaic times, she became the consort of Nilus.[2] Her first appearance on Egyptian coins date back to the last decade of BC.[3] On Roman coins, Euthenia is often compared to Abundantia, the personification of abundance and prosperity, and Annona, the personification of the grain supply to Rome.[4] References[edit] ^ Orphica, Theogonies Fragments ^ "Curtis Chapter I". www.coinsofromanegypt.org.
