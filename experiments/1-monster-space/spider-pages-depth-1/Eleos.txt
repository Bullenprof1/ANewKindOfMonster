Pausanias states that there was an altar in Athens dedicated to Eleos,[1][failed verification] at which children of Heracles sought refuge from Eurystheus' prosecution.[2][failed verification] Adrastus also came to this altar after the defeat of the Seven against Thebes, praying that those who died in the battle be buried.[citation needed] Eleos was only recognized in Athens, where she was honored by the cutting of hair and the undressing of garments at the altar.[3][4] Statius in Thebaid (1st century) describes the altar to Clementia in Athens (treating Eleos as feminine based on the grammatical gender in Latin): "There was in the midst of the city [of Athens] an altar belonging to no god of power; gentle Clementia (Clemency) [Eleos] had there her seat, and the wretched made it sacred".[citation needed] See also[edit] Look up Ἔλεος in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.
