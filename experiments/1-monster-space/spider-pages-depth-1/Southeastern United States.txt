The southeastern United States, also referred to as the American Southeast or simply the Southeast, is broadly the eastern portion of the southern United States and the southern portion of the eastern United States. It comprises at least a core of states on the lower East Coast of the United States and eastern Gulf Coast. Expansively, it includes everything south of the Mason–Dixon line, the Ohio River, the 36°30' parallel (except Missouri in certain definitions), and stretches far west as Arkansas and Louisiana.[1] There is no official U.S. government definition of the region, though various agencies and departments use different definitions.

There is no official Census Bureau definition of the southeastern United States. They instead divide a larger region which includes Texas, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and West Virginia, designated as "the South" into three separate subregions, none of which are conventionally considered to define the Southeast. The nonprofit American Association of Geographers defines the Southeastern United States as Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.[2] The OSBO (Organization Supporting Business Owners) uses the same states, but includes Arkansas and Louisiana. The states of Delaware and Missouri, along with the U.S. capital of Washington, D.C., are also sometimes added in definitions of the term. History[edit] This section does not cite any sources.

(April 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The history of human presence in the Southeast extends to before the dawn of civilization, to about 11,000 BC. The earliest artifacts were from the Clovis culture. Before the arrival of Europeans, Native Americans of the Woodland period occupied the region for several hundred years. The first Europeans to arrive in the region were conquistadors of the Spanish Empire. In 1541, Hernando de Soto journeyed through the southeast and crossed the Mississippi River. The region would host the first permanent European settlement in North America, with the Kingdom of England establishing Jamestown, Virginia in 1607. During Colonial America, the southeast states of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia would take part in the American Revolution. Prior to and during the American Civil War (1861–1865), the Confederate States of America consisted of the southeastern states of Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Louisiana, and Arkansas. Texas was a Confederate State that isn't defined as part of the southeast region. Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland and Delaware were neutral border states that remained with the Union. West Virginia would split from Virginia during 1863, and also was a border state that remained with the Union. Much of the Southeast observed Jim Crow laws during the American segregation era, which spanned from the late 19th century to the mid-1960s. Demographics[edit] Most populous states[edit] The most populous states in the region based on July 1, 2016 population estimates are Florida (20,612,439), followed by Georgia (10,310,371) and North Carolina (10,146,788).[3] State 2017 estimate 2010 census Change Land area Density Alabama 4,874,747 4,779,736 +1.99% 50,645 sq mi (131,171 km2) 96.3/sq mi (37.2/km2) Arkansas[a] 3,004,279 2,915,918 +3.03% 52,035 sq mi (134,771 km2) 57.7/sq mi (22.3/km2) Florida 20,984,400 18,801,310 +11.61% 53,625 sq mi (138,887 km2) 391.3/sq mi (151.1/km2) Georgia 10,429,379 9,687,653 +7.66% 57,513 sq mi (148,959 km2) 181.3/sq mi (70.0/km2) Kentucky[a] 4,454,189 4,339,367 +2.65% 39,486 sq mi (102,269 km2) 112.8/sq mi (43.6/km2) Louisiana[a] 4,684,333 4,533,372 +3.33% 43,204 sq mi (111,898 km2) 108.4/sq mi (41.9/km2) Mississippi 2,984,100 2,967,297 +0.57% 46,923 sq mi (121,531 km2) 63.6/sq mi (24.6/km2) North Carolina 10,273,419 9,535,483 +7.74% 48,618 sq mi (125,920 km2) 211.3/sq mi (81.6/km2) South Carolina 5,024,369 4,625,364 +8.63% 30,061 sq mi (77,857 km2) 167.1/sq mi (64.5/km2) Tennessee 6,715,984 6,346,105 +5.83% 41,235 sq mi (106,798 km2) 162.9/sq mi (62.9/km2) Virginia[a] 8,470,020 8,001,024 +5.86% 39,490 sq mi (102,279 km2) 214.5/sq mi (82.8/km2) West Virginia[a] 1,815,857 1,852,994 −2.00% 24,038 sq mi (62,259 km2) 75.5/sq mi (29.2/km2) Total 83,715,076 78,385,623 +6.80% 526,874 sq mi (1,364,597 km2) 158.9/sq mi (61.3/km2) ^ a: Arkansas, Louisiana, Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia are often labeled in other regional sections of the United States. However, since they are also often included in the Southeastern U.S. definition, they are listed here as states. U.S. territories[edit] Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are located southeast of Florida, and are considered to be in the South / Southeastern U.S. by the FAA, Agricultural Research Service, and the U.S. National Park Service.[4][5][6] Territory 2019 estimate[7][8] 2010 census Change Land area[9][8] Density Puerto Rico 3,193,694 3,725,789 −14.28% 3,459 sq mi (8,959 km2) 923.3/sq mi (356.5/km2) U.S. Virgin Islands 106,235 106,405 −0.16% 134 sq mi (346 km2) 795.2/sq mi (307.0/km2) Culture[edit] Main article: Culture of the Southern United States The predominant culture of the Southeast U.S. has its origins with the settlement of the region by European colonists and African slaves during the 17th to 19th centuries, as large groups of English, Scottish, Scotch-Irish, Germans, Spanish, French, and Acadians migrated to the region. Since the late 20th century, the "New South" has emerged as the fastest-growing area of the United States economically. Multiculturalism has become more mainstream in the Southeastern states. African Americans remain a dominant demographic, at around 30% of the total population of the Southeast. The New South from a Southeastern standpoint, is largely built upon the metropolitan areas along the Interstate 85 (I-85) corridor. Cities along this corridor from north to south include Raleigh-Durham area, Greensboro, Charlotte, Spartanburg, Greenville, Atlanta, and Montgomery. Climate[edit] Most of the southeastern part of the United States is dominated by the humid subtropical climate (Cfa/Cwa). As one nears the southern portion of Florida, the climate gradually becomes tropical, as the winter season and all months have a mean temperature above 64.4 °F (18.0 °C) (the defined coldest monthly mean temperature of tropical climates). Seasonally, summers are generally hot and humid throughout the entire region. The Bermuda High pumps hot and moist air mass from the tropical Atlantic Ocean and eastern Gulf of Mexico westward toward the southeast United States, creating the typical sultry tropical summers. Daytime highs are often in the upper 80s to lower 90s F.[10][11] Rainfall is summer concentrated along the Gulf Coast and the South Atlantic coast from Norfolk, Virginia southward, reaching a sharp summer monsoon-like pattern over peninsular Florida, with dry winters and wet summers. Sunshine is abundant across the southeastern United States in summer, as the rainfall often comes in quick, but intense downpours. The mid-South, especially Tennessee, and the northern halves of Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia, have maximum monthly rainfall amounts in winter and spring, owing to copious Gulf moisture and clashes between warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cold, dry air from Canada during the cold season. In this area, December, March, or April are typically the wettest months; August to October, the driest months (for example, in Tupelo, MS, Huntsville, AL and Memphis, TN). Winters are colder in areas like East Tennessee and Western North Carolina, with average highs in the 45 °F (7 °C) range in January. Farther south, winters become milder across interior eastern North and South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, with average January highs in the 53 °F (12 °C) range. As one nears the Gulf of Mexico, coastal plain, and coastal areas of Georgia and the Carolinas, winters become warm, with daytime highs near or over 60 °F (16 °C), until far enough south in central Florida where daytime highs are above 70 °F (21 °C). Winters tend to be very dry and sunny across Florida, with a gradual increase in winter rainfall with increasing latitude, especially west of the Appalachian Mountains.

See Wikipedia's guide to writing better articles for further suggestions. (March 2014) The Southeast economically has changed dramatically since the late 20th century. There has been a boom in its service economy, manufacturing base, high technology industries, and the financial sector. Examples of this include the surge in tourism in Florida and along the Gulf Coast; the numerous new automobile production plants such as Mercedes-Benz in Tuscaloosa; Hyundai in Montgomery; Toyota Motors in Blue Springs, Mississippi; Kia in West Point, Georgia; BMW production plant in Greer, South Carolina; Volkswagen in Chattanooga; GM manufacturing plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee; and the Nissan North American headquarters in Franklin, Tennessee; the two largest research parks in the country: Research Triangle Park in the Triangle area of North Carolina (the world's largest) and the Cummings Research Park in Huntsville, Alabama (the world's fourth largest); and the corporate headquarters of Verso Paper and FedEx in Memphis. In 2020, Fortune 500 companies having headquarters in the Southeast region include: 22 in Virginia, 18 in Georgia, 18 in Florida, 13 in North Carolina, and 10 in Tennessee.[12] This economic expansion has enabled parts of the South to have of some of the lowest unemployment rates in the United States.[13] In Alabama, there is the large-scale manufacturing project owned by the German steel megacorporation ThyssenKrupp, which operates a massive, state-of-the-art facility in Mobile. Even with certain states and areas in the Southeast doing well economically, many Southeast states and areas still have a high poverty rate when compared to the U.S. nationally. In 2017, seven Southeast states were in the top ten nationwide when it came to having the highest poverty rate.[14] Research and development areas[edit] Research Triangle Park in the Raleigh–Durham urban area of North Carolina, has emerged as a major hub of technology, governmental, and biotechnological research and development. The Cummings Research Park in the Huntsville, Alabama area, is the second-largest research complex in the nation. Located in Huntsville is the Redstone Arsenal, United States Army Missile Command, the U.S. Space & Rocket Center, NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and other key government, military, and aerospace agencies. Tullahoma, TN contains the Arnold Air Force Base. The base is home to the Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC), the most advanced and largest complex of flight simulation test facilities in the world. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida, is the largest laboratory in the world devoted to the study of magnetism.[15] The University of South Carolina is currently constructing a research campus in downtown Columbia, and the university is the nation's only National Science Foundation-funded Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Fuel Cells.[16] Education[edit] This section does not cite any sources.

United States, it is especially pervasive in the Southeast. With a total of nine franchises — the Atlanta Falcons, the Baltimore Ravens, the Carolina Panthers, the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Miami Dolphins, the New Orleans Saints, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Tennessee Titans, and the Washington Football Team — across the region, the National Football League (NFL) maintains a stronger commercial presence than any other major North American professional sports league. The Southeast has seven National Basketball Association (NBA) franchises: the Atlanta Hawks, the Charlotte Hornets, the Memphis Grizzlies, the Miami Heat, the New Orleans Pelicans, the Orlando Magic, and the Washington Wizards. Major League Baseball (MLB) maintains five teams in the Southeast: the Atlanta Braves, the Baltimore Orioles, the Miami Marlins, the Tampa Bay Rays, and the Washington Nationals. The Southeast has five National Hockey League (NHL) franchises: the Carolina Hurricanes, the Florida Panthers, the Nashville Predators, the Tampa Bay Lightning, and the Washington Capitals. Major League Soccer currently holds five clubs — Atlanta United FC, DC United, Inter Miami CF, Nashville SC and Orlando City SC— in the region. This number will increase to six when Charlotte FC joins in 2022. The Atlantic Coast Conference is an NCAA Division I conference of mainly Southeastern college teams, including the Florida State Seminoles, Louisville Cardinals, Miami Hurricanes, Clemson Tigers and Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, Wake Forest Demon Deacons, Duke Blue Devils, North Carolina Tar Heels, NC State Wolfpack, Virginia Tech Hokies, and Virginia Cavaliers. The Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, Peach Bowl, and Citrus Bowl are notable college football bowls held in Southeastern cities. The Southeastern Conference is also an NCAA Division I conference of Southeastern college teams, including the Alabama Crimson Tide, Arkansas Razorbacks, Auburn Tigers, Florida Gators, Georgia Bulldogs, Kentucky Wildcats, LSU Tigers, Ole Miss Rebels, Mississippi State Bulldogs, Missouri Tigers, South Carolina Gamecocks, Tennessee Volunteers, Texas A&M Aggies, and Vanderbilt Commodores. The majority of NASCAR teams are headquartered in the Charlotte area along with the sports operations headquarters and media outlets. Tracks in the region include Atlanta Motor Speedway, Bristol Motor Speedway, Charlotte Motor Speedway, Darlington Raceway, Daytona International Speedway, Homestead-Miami Speedway, Martinsville Speedway, Nashville Superspeedway, Richmond Raceway, and Talladega Superspeedway. The southeast also hosts two of the three legs of the American Triple Crown: the Kentucky Derby, in Kentucky, and the Preakness Stakes is also located in the Southeast, being run in Baltimore. The Derby is considered the western leg of the crown and the Preakness is traditionally considered the southern leg.
