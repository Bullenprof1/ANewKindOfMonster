In 2010 it was released on DVD from the sister company by Universal Pictures.[1] Contents 1 Synopsis 2 Cast 3 Reception 4 References 5 External links Synopsis[edit] The movie posits Grendel's mother as a monster ("Hag") who demands monthly sacrifice from the Danes; king Hrothgar and his wife Wealhþeow have agreed to the scheme, with the result that by the time the hero Beowulf comes to the kingdom of the Danes there are almost no children left, and Hrothgar bemoans the fact that he has become as monstrous as the monster. After she disappears from the scene her son, Grendel, continues her reign of terror.
