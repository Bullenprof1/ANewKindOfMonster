The cube is the only regular hexahedron and is one of the five Platonic solids. It has 6 faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices. The cube is also a square parallelepiped, an equilateral cuboid and a right rhombohedron. It is a regular square prism in three orientations, and a trigonal trapezohedron in four orientations. The cube is dual to the octahedron. It has cubical or octahedral symmetry. The cube is the only convex polyhedron whose faces are all squares.

The first and third correspond to the A2 and B2 Coxeter planes. Orthogonal projections Centered by Face Vertex Coxeter planes B2 A2 Projective symmetry [4] [6] Tilted views Spherical tiling[edit] The cube can also be represented as a spherical tiling, and projected onto the plane via a stereographic projection. This projection is conformal, preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane. Orthographic projection Stereographic projection Cartesian coordinates[edit] For a cube centered at the origin, with edges parallel to the axes and with an edge length of 2, the Cartesian coordinates of the vertices are (±1, ±1, ±1) while the interior consists of all points (x0, x1, x2) with −1 < xi < 1 for all i. Equation in R 3 {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}} [edit] In analytic geometry, a cube's surface with center (x0, y0, z0) and edge length of 2a is the locus of all points (x, y, z) such that max { | x − x 0 | , | y − y 0 | , | z − z 0 | } = a . {\displaystyle \max\{|x-x_{0}|,|y-y_{0}|,|z-z_{0}|\}=a.} A cube can also be considered the limiting case of a 3D superellipsoid as all three exponents approach infinity. Formulas[edit] For a cube of edge length a {\displaystyle a} : surface area 6 a 2 {\displaystyle 6a^{2}\,} volume a 3 {\displaystyle a^{3}\,} face diagonal 2 a {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}a} space diagonal 3 a {\textstyle {\sqrt {3}}a} radius of circumscribed sphere 3 2 a {\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}a} radius of sphere tangent to edges a 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {a}{\sqrt {2}}}} radius of inscribed sphere a 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {a}{2}}} angles between faces (in radians) π 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{2}}} As the volume of a cube is the third power of its sides a × a × a {\displaystyle a\times a\times a} , third powers are called cubes, by analogy with squares and second powers. A cube has the largest volume among cuboids (rectangular boxes) with a given surface area. Also, a cube has the largest volume among cuboids with the same total linear size (length+width+height). Point in space[edit] For a cube whose circumscribing sphere has radius R, and for a given point in its 3-dimensional space with distances di from the cube's eight vertices, we have:[2] ∑ i = 1 8 d i 4 8 + 16 R 4 9 = ( ∑ i = 1 8 d i 2 8 + 2 R 2 3 ) 2 . {\displaystyle {\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{8}d_{i}^{4}}{8}}+{\frac {16R^{4}}{9}}=\left({\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{8}d_{i}^{2}}{8}}+{\frac {2R^{2}}{3}}\right)^{2}.} Doubling the cube[edit] Doubling the cube, or the Delian problem, was the problem posed by ancient Greek mathematicians of using only a compass and straightedge to start with the length of the edge of a given cube and to construct the length of the edge of a cube with twice the volume of the original cube. They were unable to solve this problem, and in 1837 Pierre Wantzel proved it to be impossible because the cube root of 2 is not a constructible number. Uniform colorings and symmetry[edit] Octahedral symmetry tree The cube has three uniform colorings, named by the colors of the square faces around each vertex: 111, 112, 123. The cube has four classes of symmetry, which can be represented by vertex-transitive coloring the faces. The highest octahedral symmetry Oh has all the faces the same color. The dihedral symmetry D4h comes from the cube being a prism, with all four sides being the same color. The prismatic subsets D2d has the same coloring as the previous one and D2h has alternating colors for its sides for a total of three colors, paired by opposite sides. Each symmetry form has a different Wythoff symbol.

These familiar six-sided dice are cube-shaped. A cube has eleven nets (one shown above): that is, there are eleven ways to flatten a hollow cube by cutting seven edges.[3] To color the cube so that no two adjacent faces have the same color, one would need at least three colors. The cube is the cell of the only regular tiling of three-dimensional Euclidean space. It is also unique among the Platonic solids in having faces with an even number of sides and, consequently, it is the only member of that group that is a zonohedron (every face has point symmetry). The cube can be cut into six identical square pyramids. If these square pyramids are then attached to the faces of a second cube, a rhombic dodecahedron is obtained (with pairs of coplanar triangles combined into rhombic faces). Other dimensions[edit] The analogue of a cube in four-dimensional Euclidean space has a special name—a tesseract or hypercube. More properly, a hypercube (or n-dimensional cube or simply n-cube) is the analogue of the cube in n-dimensional Euclidean space and a tesseract is the order-4 hypercube. A hypercube is also called a measure polytope. There are analogues of the cube in lower dimensions too: a point in dimension 0, a line segment in one dimension and a square in two dimensions. Related polyhedra[edit] The dual of a cube is an octahedron, seen here with vertices at the center of the cube's square faces. The hemicube is the 2-to-1 quotient of the cube. The quotient of the cube by the antipodal map yields a projective polyhedron, the hemicube. If the original cube has edge length 1, its dual polyhedron (an octahedron) has edge length 2 / 2 {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\sqrt {2}}/2} . The cube is a special case in various classes of general polyhedra: Name Equal edge-lengths? Equal angles? Right angles? Cube Yes Yes Yes Rhombohedron Yes Yes No Cuboid No Yes Yes Parallelepiped No Yes No quadrilaterally faced hexahedron No No No The vertices of a cube can be grouped into two groups of four, each forming a regular tetrahedron; more generally this is referred to as a demicube. These two together form a regular compound, the stella octangula. The intersection of the two forms a regular octahedron. The symmetries of a regular tetrahedron correspond to those of a cube which map each tetrahedron to itself; the other symmetries of the cube map the two to each other. One such regular tetrahedron has a volume of 1/3 of that of the cube. The remaining space consists of four equal irregular tetrahedra with a volume of 1/6 of that of the cube, each. The rectified cube is the cuboctahedron. If smaller corners are cut off we get a polyhedron with six octagonal faces and eight triangular ones. In particular we can get regular octagons (truncated cube). The rhombicuboctahedron is obtained by cutting off both corners and edges to the correct amount. A cube can be inscribed in a dodecahedron so that each vertex of the cube is a vertex of the dodecahedron and each edge is a diagonal of one of the dodecahedron's faces; taking all such cubes gives rise to the regular compound of five cubes. If two opposite corners of a cube are truncated at the depth of the three vertices directly connected to them, an irregular octahedron is obtained. Eight of these irregular octahedra can be attached to the triangular faces of a regular octahedron to obtain the cuboctahedron. The cube is topologically related to a series of spherical polyhedra and tilings with order-3 vertex figures. *n32 symmetry mutation of regular tilings: {n,3} v t e Spherical Euclidean Compact hyperb.
