In 1977, the track was released as a single to coincide with the re-release of the movie King Kong, which charted at #94 in Australia,[3] where it had previously been the B-side to "I've Been Waiting for You". It received a substantial amount of unsolicited airplay in Sweden, even though by then three years and two albums had come and gone since its original 1974 conception. The song bears a resemblance to the style of the Beach Boys. In 1974, the song competed in the Swedish radio chart show Tio i topp, where it stayed in the charts for four shows and peaked at #4.[4] Also in Sweden, "King Kong Song" was the B-side to "Honey, Honey". Cover versions[edit] Alternative rock band Electric Boys recorded a cover of the song for the 1992 Swedish tribute album ABBA: The Tribute, released on the Polar Music label. Swedish band Moahni Moahna recorded a cover for their 1996 album Why. References[edit] ^ Sheffield, Rob (11 August 2018). "The 25 Best ABBA Songs, Ranked". Rolling Stone.
