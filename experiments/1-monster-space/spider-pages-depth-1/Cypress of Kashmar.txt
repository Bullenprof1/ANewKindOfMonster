According to the Iranian epic Shahnameh, the tree had grown from a branch Zoroaster had carried away from Paradise and which he planted in honor of King Vishtaspa's conversion to Zoroastrianism in Kashmar. In 861 AD, Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil ordered the tree be felled and transported to his capital in Samarra where its wood would be used as beams for his new palace. The palace and its spiral minaret still stand today.[1][2] See also[edit] Adur Burzen-Mihr Zoroastrian Sarv Torshiz References[edit] ^ "The Destruction of Sacred Trees". www.goldenassay.com.
