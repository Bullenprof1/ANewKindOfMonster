He studied at the Yale School of Drama for three years and became a member of their professional acting company. In 1996 he married Perry Adleman, a writer, camera assistant and photographer. They have twin children Daisy Virginia and Harry Francis. In 1980, Clennon provided the voice for Admiral Motti in NPR's Star Wars The Original Radio Drama. He was a regular on the TV shows Barney Miller, Almost Perfect, The Agency, and Saved. Most recently, Clennon played Carl Sessick (a.k.a. Carl the Watcher) on Ghost Whisperer. Clennon also appeared on Star Trek Voyager as Dr. Crell Moset. In 1993 he won an Emmy award for his guest appearance on the series Dream On.[2] He often performs at New Haven, Connecticut's Long Wharf Theatre. Political activism[edit] He was a staunch opponent of the Vietnam War, often participating in protests, and remains politically active. In 2013, he repeatedly spoke out against the film Zero Dark Thirty and refused to vote for it for an Academy Award, stating that it promotes the acceptable use of torture.[3] I firmly believe that the film Zero Dark Thirty promotes the acceptance of the crime of torture as a legitimate weapon in America's so-called war on terror. In that belief, following my conscience, I will not vote for Zero Dark Thirty in any category. I cannot vote for a film that makes heroes of Americans who commit the crime of torture.[4] In 2018, he opposed the Emmy nominations, of which there were four, for Ken Burns' 10-part documentary program The Vietnam War on the grounds that the series contained "half-truths, distortions and omissions" about the war.[5] Filmography[edit] The Paper Chase (1973) - Toombs Helter Skelter (1976, TV Movie) - Harry Jones Bound for Glory (1976) - Carl - Man in Gas Station The Greatest (1977) Coming Home (1978) - Tim Gray Lady Down (1978) - Crew member of USS Neptune Go Tell the Spartans (1978) - Lt.
