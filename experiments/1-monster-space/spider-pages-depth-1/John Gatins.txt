Pictures.[9] Filmography[edit] Year Film Credit Notes 2000 Ready to Rumble Co-producer 2001 Summer Catch Screenplay by Co-producer Co-wrote with Kevin Falls Hardball Screenplay by 2005 Coach Carter Written by Co-wrote with Mark Schwahn Dreamer Director Written by 2006 Ciggies Special thanks Short film 2007 Eagle vs Shark Special thanks 2009 Harmony and Me Thanks 2011 Real Steel Screenplay by Martha Marcy May Marlene Thanks 2012 Flight Written by Nominated—Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay 2014 Need for Speed Story by Producer Co-wrote with George Gatins 2016 Spectral Uncredited script contributions 2017 Kong: Skull Island Story by Power Rangers Screenplay by Executive producer The House of Tomorrow Special thanks As an actor Year Title Role Notes 1993 Witchboard 2: The Devil's Doorway Russel 1994 Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings Young Caspar Dixon Direct-to-video 1995 Leprechaun 3 Scott McCoy Direct-to-video 1998 Gods and Monsters Kid Saylor Uncredited Another Day in Paradise Phil 1999 Varsity Blues Smiling Man 2002 Impostor Patient-Soldier Big Fat Liar Tow Truck Driver 2006 The Shaggy Dog Homeless Guy 2007 Norbit Attendant 2008 Meet Dave Air Traffic Controller 2009 Harmony and Me Homeless Tom 2010 Fred: The Movie Car Wash Clerk #1 TV movie Terriers Beach Bum TV series, episode "Hail Mary" 2011 Real Steel Kingpin Screenwriter also Fred 2: Night of the Living Fred Dishwasher 2012 A Thousand Words Valet 2017 Crazy Ex-Girlfriend Jeff Channington TV series, episode "Getting Over Jeff"[10] 2019 Lying and Stealing References[edit] ^ a b "'Flight': Screenwriter John Gatins confronts his fears".
