History[edit] The first Suncoast store opened in Roseville, Minnesota, in 1986 as Paramount Pictures, changing their name to Suncoast Motion Picture Company in 1988. In 1999, Musicland launched websites for Suncoast, Sam Goody, and Media Play. In 2001, Best Buy purchased their then parent-company, Musicland, for $685 million.[1] In January 2003, Best Buy closed 20 Suncoast stores as part of a larger closing that included 90 Sam Goody stores.[2] Later that year in June 2003, Sun Capital Partners assumed Musicland's liabilities from Best Buy.[3] In January 2006, The Musicland Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York; store closures during the bankruptcy included 80 Suncoast stores [4][5] A dirty label scar on the floor in front of a vacant store inside the Hamilton Mall, Mays Landing, NJ In late March 2006, Trans World Entertainment Corp. completed the purchase of nearly all of the assets of Musicland Holding Corporation for $104.2 million in cash and $18.1 million in assumed liabilities.[6] TWEC retained the Suncoast name on around 170 stores after acquisition. However, on December 26, 2009, they announced the closure of 150 Suncoast stores nationwide. By 2021 only 6 Suncoast Motion Picture Company stores remain in the chain.
