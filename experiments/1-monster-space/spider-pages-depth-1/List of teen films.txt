Wikimedia list article Teen film is a film genre targeted at teenagers and young adults in which the plot is based upon the lives of teenagers and young adults, such as coming of age, first love, rebellion, conflict with parents, teen angst, and alienation and other topics / issues in the personal and professional lives of teenagers & young adults. Some of these films are targeted at adults as well as teenagers. Teen films have been a trope of the cinema industry that grew in popularity in the 1950s.[1][2] At this time, the film industry saw a greater market for teens with more disposable income and therefore more money to spend on leisure activities, largely going to films. Because of the boom in teen viewers, drive-in movie theaters were also very popular.[2] However, teen films have been produced since the dawn of the 20th century. Recently, online streaming services such as Netflix have created a resurgence in the "tween" and teenage-oriented film.[3] Contents 1 Subgenres 1.1 Teen Fantasy & Science Fiction 1.1.1 Franchises 1.1.2 Stand-Alone 1.2 Teen Animated Films 1.3 Teen Horror & Horror-Comedy 1.3.1 Franchises 1.3.2 Stand-Alone 1.4 Teen Musicals 1.4.1 Franchises 1.4.2 Stand-Alone 1.5 Teen Comedy & Teen Drama 1.5.1 1910s 1.5.2 1920s 1.5.3 1930s 1.5.4 1940s 1.5.5 1950s 1.5.6 1960s 1.5.7 1970s 1.5.8 1980s 1.5.9 1990s 1.5.10 2000s 1.5.11 2010s 1.5.12 2020s 2 See also 3 References 3.1 Sources Subgenres[edit] Teen Fantasy & Science Fiction[edit] Franchises[edit] The NeverEnding Story (1984), The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter (1990), and The NeverEnding Story III (1994) Back to the Future (1985),[4] Back to the Future Part II (1989) and Back to the Future Part III (1990) Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989), Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey (1991) Class of 1999 (1990) and Class of 1999 II: The Substitute (1994) Jumanji franchise (1995–2019) Halloweentown (1998–2006) Legally Blonde (2001-present) Harry Potter film series (2001–2011) Spider-Man: Spider-Man (2002), Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007) The Amazing Spider-Man (2012), and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014) Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) The Twilight Saga (2008-2012) Kick-Ass (2010) and Kick-Ass 2 (2013) Percy Jackson film series (2010-2013) Divergent (2014), The Divergent Series: Insurgent (2015), and The Divergent Series: Allegiant (2016) The Hunger Games film series (2012–2015) The Maze Runner (2014), Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials (2015), and Maze Runner: The Death Cure (2018) Stand-Alone[edit] The 5th Wave (2016) Aquamarine (2006) Casper (1995) Chronicle (2012) Donnie Darko (2001)[5] Don't Look Under the Bed (1999) Edward Scissorhands (1990) Ever After (1998) Ella Enchanted (2004) The Faculty (1998)[5] Freaky Friday (2003) Girl vs. Monster (2012) The Giver (2014) Hackers (1995) Herbie: Fully Loaded (2005) Hocus Pocus (1993) The Host (2013) Love, Rosie (2014) Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie (1995) Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (2016) Mamaboy (2017) The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones (2013) My Science Project (1985) Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004) Pleasantville (1998)[5] Power Rangers (2017) Project Almanac (2014) Ready Player One (2018) Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010)[6][7] Small Soldiers (1998) Susie Q (1996) Stepsister from Planet Weird (2000) Teen Witch (1989) Teen Wolf (1985) Teen Wolf Too (1987) Tomorrowland (2015) The Ultimate Christmas Present (2000) WarGames (1983) WarGames: The Dead Code (2008) Weird Science (1985)[8] Wish Upon a Star (1996) Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century (1999) Zenon: The Zequel (2001) Zenon: Z3 (2004) Teen Animated Films[edit] Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) Cinderella (1950) Peter Pan (1953) Sleeping Beauty (1959) The Little Mermaid (1989) Beauty and the Beast (1991) Aladdin (1992) Bébé's Kids (1992) FernGully: The Last Rainforest (1992) The Pagemaster (1994) Thumbelina (1994) The Lion King (1994) A Goofy Movie (1995) Pocahontas (1995) Beavis and Butthead Do America (1996) Anastasia (1997) Hercules (1997) Mulan (1998) The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (1998) The Prince of Egypt (1998) Doug's First Movie (1999) The Iron Giant (1999) South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (1999) Titan A.E.
