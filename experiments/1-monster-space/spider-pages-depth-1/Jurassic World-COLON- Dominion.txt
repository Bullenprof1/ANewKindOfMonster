It is the sequel to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), the sixth installment in the Jurassic Park franchise, and the third film in the Jurassic World trilogy. As with its predecessors, Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley will produce the film, with Trevorrow and Jurassic Park (1993) director Steven Spielberg acting as executive producers. The film stars an ensemble cast including Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Laura Dern, Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum, Daniella Pineda, Isabella Sermon, Justice Smith, Omar Sy, Jake Johnson, and BD Wong reprising their roles from previous films in the franchise, and they are joined by Mamoudou Athie, Scott Haze, Dichen Lachman, Campbell Scott, and DeWanda Wise. The film was being planned as early as 2014, part of a future Jurassic World trilogy. Filming began in Canada in February 2020 and moved to other locations in England the following month. In March 2020, production was put on hiatus as a safety precaution due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Production resumed in July 2020, and concluded four months later in November, with filming locations that included England's Pinewood Studios and the country of Malta. Jurassic World: Dominion is scheduled for theatrical release on June 10, 2022, by Universal Pictures.[4] Contents 1 Cast 2 Production 2.1 Development 2.2 Pre-production 2.3 Writing 2.4 Casting 2.5 Filming 2.5.1 COVID-19 pandemic 3 Release 3.1 Theatrical 4 Future 5 References 6 External links Cast[edit] Main article: List of Jurassic Park characters The film includes the following cast members:[5] Chris Pratt as Owen Grady[6] Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing[6] Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler[7] Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant[7] Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm[7] Mamoudou Athie[8] Scott Haze[9] Dichen Lachman[10] Daniella Pineda as Zia Rodriguez[11] Campbell Scott as Dr. Lewis Dodgson. The character was previously portrayed by Cameron Thor in Jurassic Park.[12] Isabella Sermon as Maisie Lockwood[13] Justice Smith as Franklin Webb[11] Omar Sy as Barry Sembène[14][15] DeWanda Wise[16] BD Wong as Dr. Henry Wu[17] Jake Johnson as Lowery Cruthers[14] Dimitri Thivaios[18] Production[edit] Development[edit] During early conversations on Jurassic World (2015), executive producer Steven Spielberg told director Colin Trevorrow that he was interested in having several more films made.[19] In April 2014, Trevorrow announced that sequels to Jurassic World had been discussed: "We wanted to create something that would be a little bit less arbitrary and episodic, and something that could potentially arc into a series that would feel like a complete story."[20] Actor Chris Pratt, who portrayed Owen in Jurassic World, was signed on for future films in the series.[21] Trevorrow said that the friendship in Jurassic World between Owen and Barry (portrayed by Omar Sy) could carry on into the sequels.[20] In May 2015, Trevorrow stated his desire to have other directors work on future films in the series, believing that different directors could bring different qualities to future films.[22] The following month, Trevorrow further stated "I think this is one of those franchises — like Mission: Impossible and like what they're currently doing with Star Wars — that is going to really benefit from new voices and new points of view. […] down the line, looking at the way that franchises have been working, I'm pretty confident this is the right answer for this one. We need to keep it new and keep it changing and constantly let it evolve."[23] Trevorrow also said that the series would not always be about a dinosaur theme park, stating that future films could explore the idea of dinosaurs and humans co-existing.[19] In September 2015, Trevorrow said that Bryce Dallas Howard's character, Claire, would evolve the most over the course of a Jurassic World trilogy that was already being planned while he wrote Jurassic World.[24] The next month, Jurassic World producer Frank Marshall confirmed plans for a third Jurassic World film.[25] In November 2015, Universal Pictures chairman Donna Langley said that Trevorrow and Spielberg had a story idea for the film.[26] In September 2016, plans for a Jurassic World trilogy were reaffirmed,[27] and Trevorrow was asked how much planning he had put into a trilogy while he was filming Jurassic World in 2014: "I knew the end. I knew where I wanted it to go."[28] Trevorrow later said that planning the beginning, middle, and end of the trilogy ahead of time "is crucial to a franchise like this if you really want to bring people along with you and make sure they stay interested. It needs to be thought through on that level. It can't be arbitrary [...] the earlier Jurassic Park movies had pretty clear definitive endings. They were much more episodic."[29] Pre-production[edit] In February 2018, it was announced that the untitled film, known then as Jurassic World 3, would be released on June 11, 2021.[30][31] It was also announced that Trevorrow would write the script with Emily Carmichael, based on a story by Trevorrow and his writing partner, Derek Connolly, who worked with Trevorrow on the scripts for the previous Jurassic World films. As with the previous films, Marshall and Patrick Crowley will serve as producers, with Trevorrow and Spielberg as executive producers.[32][33][30] On March 30, 2018, it was announced that Trevorrow would also direct the film,[34] after he was asked by Spielberg to do so.[6] J. A. Bayona had directed the previous film, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, and Trevorrow was inspired by Bayona's work on the film, saying that it "made me want to finish what we started."[35] Writing[edit] During development of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom in 2015, Trevorrow, the film's co-writer and executive producer, said that Fallen Kingdom could involve dinosaurs going open source, resulting in multiple entities around the world being able to create their own dinosaurs for various uses.[36][37] Certain scenes and ideas regarding the integration of dinosaurs into the world were ultimately removed from the Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom script to be saved for the third film, and to keep the second film's story focused.[38] According to Bayona, "There were moments that we thought, this is more like a Jurassic [World] 3 scene so we took them out from the script. Some of those scenes we thought were better seen in a world where dinosaurs had spread all over the world. Colin, from time to time, came to me and said, 'I want this character to say that line because this is a moment that's referencing something I want to use in Jurassic 3'."[39] Trevorrow met Carmichael after seeing a short film of hers, and said, "I just knew immediately that I loved her brain."[40] Trevorrow was subsequently impressed with Carmichael's writing work on Pacific Rim Uprising (2018) and a remake of The Black Hole, leading him to choose her as a co-writer for Jurassic World 3.[40][41] Trevorrow and Carmichael were writing the script as of April 2018. Trevorrow said that Jurassic World 3 would be a "science thriller," describing it as being the Jurassic World film that would most closely match the tone of the franchise's first film, Jurassic Park.[6] He also said the film would not include any hybrid dinosaurs, which had prominent roles in the earlier Jurassic World films.[42] Trevorrow later described the film as a "celebration of everything that has existed in the franchise up until now."[43] Following the 2018 release of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Trevorrow stated that the sequel would focus on the dinosaurs that went open source after being sold and spread around the world in Fallen Kingdom, allowing people other than Dr. Henry Wu to create their own dinosaurs.[44][38][39] Trevorrow stated that the film would be set around the world, and said that the idea of Henry Wu being the only person who knows how to create a dinosaur was far-fetched "after 30 years of this technology existing" within the films' universe.[38] Additionally, the film would focus on the dinosaurs that were freed at the end of Fallen Kingdom,[44][38][39] but it would not depict dinosaurs terrorizing cities, an idea that Trevorrow considered unrealistic. Instead, Trevorrow was interested in a world where "a dinosaur might run out in front of your car on a foggy backroad, or invade your campground looking for food. A world where dinosaur interaction is unlikely but possible—the same way we watch out for bears or sharks. We hunt animals, we traffic them, we herd them, we breed them, we invade their territory and pay the price, but we don't go to war with them."[45] Trevorrow said that the film would also be about Owen and Claire's redemption, and their responsibility to take care of Maisie, a cloned girl from the previous film.[44] Trevorrow said about the film and its predecessors, "I have a dinosaur movie that I've always wanted to see, and it took two movies to earn it."[39] Regarding the realism of the film's story, Trevorrow said, "I think what's very important and what could fall apart, if just dinosaurs [are] everywhere all the time. I think any kind of global acceptance that they are just around doesn't feel real to me because, even now when you think of animals, when was the last time you saw a tiger walking down the street? We know there are tigers. We know they're out there. But to me, it's very important that we keep this grounded in the context of our relationship with wild animals today."[46] Howard stated that she wanted the film to "blow your mind in terms of being like, 'Whoa, this is where this technology can go. This is what the world could really turn into if this technology fell into the wrong hands.' So basically seeing a world with dinosaurs everywhere."[47] Trevorrow stated that his goal with the Jurassic World trilogy was to have Claire's line from the first film, "No one is impressed by a dinosaur anymore," be proven false in the final film.[46] Casting[edit] Actress Laura Dern, who portrayed Dr. Ellie Sattler in the earlier Jurassic Park film trilogy, commented in March 2017, "As I said to the people who are making the new series, 'If you guys make a last one, you gotta let Ellie Sattler come back.'"[48] Dern expressed further interest in reprising her role later that year.[49] Trevorrow announced in April 2018 that Pratt and Howard would reprise their roles from the previous films, and that there were other characters in Fallen Kingdom who "you'll realize are major characters."[6] Later that year, Howard said that her top desire for the film was to include more characters from the Jurassic Park trilogy,[50] including Ellie Sattler and Jeff Goldblum's character Ian Malcolm.[51][47] Trevorrow hinted that Sam Neill and Dern could reprise their roles for the film. Neill previously portrayed Dr. Alan Grant in earlier films.[39][44] Trevorrow also said that Dr. Henry Wu, featured in the previous Jurassic World films, was an important character in the film's story.[44] In September 2019, Neill, Dern, and Goldblum were confirmed to be returning for the film in major roles.[52][53][7] They will appear throughout the film.[54] Jurassic World: Dominion will mark Neill and Dern's first appearance in the film series since Jurassic Park III (2001). It will also mark the trio's first film appearance together since the original Jurassic Park film, while Goldblum briefly reprised his role in Fallen Kingdom.[55][56] Trevorrow said he would work with the three actors to ensure their characters are portrayed accurately, saying, "They know and love these characters." Trevorrow also said the film would answer questions about the characters such as "who are these people now? What do they make of the new world they're living in, and how do they feel about being part of its history?"[56] Neill said he would get into physical shape to prepare for the role, which would include running.[57][58] In October 2019, Mamoudou Athie and DeWanda Wise were cast in lead roles.[8][59] Athie did not go through an auditioning or screen test process, and instead was cast after a meeting with Trevorrow, who had seen him in a previous film and was impressed by his performance.[60] At the end of 2019, it was announced that Justice Smith and Daniella Pineda would reprise their roles from Fallen Kingdom.[11] Isabella Sermon also reprises her role as Maisie from Fallen Kingdom.[13] In early 2020, it was announced that Jake Johnson and Omar Sy would reprise their roles from Jurassic World,[14] and that Dichen Lachman and Scott Haze had been cast in roles as well.[10][9] BD Wong was also confirmed to reprise his role as Dr. Henry Wu from earlier films.[17] It was announced in June 2020 that Campbell Scott would portray Lewis Dodgson, a character briefly featured in the first Jurassic Park film. The role was originally played by Cameron Thor, but was recast for Jurassic World: Dominion as Thor had since been arrested for sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl and is serving six years in a state prison.[12] Pratt compared Jurassic World: Dominion to another film he was in, Avengers: Endgame (2019), as both films feature the return of numerous characters from their respective franchises.[61] Andy Buckley, who portrayed Scott Mitchell in Jurassic World, stated that he was at one point attached to reprise his role, but his inclusion was dropped during rewrites.[62] Filming[edit] On February 19, 2020, a production unit used drones to film aerial scenes at Cathedral Grove on Canada's Vancouver Island.[63][64] Principal photography began on February 24, 2020, and the film's title was announced the following day as Jurassic World: Dominion.[65][66] Filming in the Canadian city of Merritt, British Columbia was scheduled to begin on February 25, 2020.[67][68][69] Filming in Merritt concluded in early March,[70][71] and the shoot included the city's downtown area.[72] Later in March 2020, production moved to England's Hawley Common, where parts of the previous film were shot. Filming in Hawley Common, as well as Minley Woods, took place over a three-night shoot from March 9–11, with helicopter filming on the final night.[73][74] Other filming locations in England would include Pinewood Studios, where the previous film was shot.[75][76] Filming at the studios would include the 007 Stage, where large sets were assembled.[77] An exterior set at Pinewood Studios depicted a crashed plane in a snowy environment.[78] Other filming locations would include the country of Malta and its capital city Valletta.[79] Malta was chosen as a filming location after the country's film commission introduced financial incentives in April 2019, hoping to attract the project to the area.[80] The film's budget is $165 million.[81] John Schwartzman is the film's cinematographer, returning to the position after working with Trevorrow on the first Jurassic World film.[82] The film is shot under the working title Arcadia, which is the name of the ship that transported dinosaurs to the U.S. mainland in the previous film.[67][73] The film uses more animatronic dinosaurs than the previous Jurassic World films.[83] The animatronics were created by John Nolan,[84][85] and paleontologist Steve Brusatte is a science consultant on the film.[86][87] COVID-19 pandemic[edit] On March 13, 2020, production was put on hiatus as a safety precaution due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A decision on when to resume production was originally expected within several weeks.[88] Following the delay, the filmmakers saved time by doing post-production work on the footage that was already shot.[89][90] Most of these scenes featured dinosaurs, allowing the visual effects team to get started on the creatures.[90] Universal eventually confirmed that filming would resume in July 2020, at Pinewood Studios. Universal planned to spend approximately $5 million on various safety protocols, including thousands of COVID-19 tests for each cast and crew member, who would be tested before production resumed and multiple times during filming. A medical facility would be commissioned to perform the tests, and doctors and nurses would be located on-site during filming. The cast and crew would also undergo COVID-19 training, and the Pinewood set would include 150 hand sanitizer stations and 1,800 safety signs to remind them of safety precautions such as social distancing. Walk-through temperature testing stations would also be built. All members of the production team would be required to wear masks, except for actors during filming.[91] The cast received a 109-page document outlining various safety protocols.[92] In addition, the 750-person production team was divided in two groups, with a larger group consisting of crew members involved in construction, props, and other pre-filming activities. The smaller group consisted of Trevorrow, the cast, and essential crew members.[93] Filming resumed on July 6, 2020.[94] An entire hotel in England was rented out by Universal for the remainder of the shoot, allowing the cast and crew to quarantine there for two weeks before resuming filming. After quarantine, they were allowed to freely roam the hotel without social distancing or mask-wearing. The cast and hotel employees were tested three times a week. Renting an entire hotel, combined with the COVID-19 precautions, convinced the cast that it would be safe to resume filming.[93] The hotel provided a protective "bubble" for the cast and crew.[81][95][96] Trevorrow encouraged the cast members to make their own creative suggestions regarding their respective characters.[97][98] He and the cast formed a close relationship while living together for four months, allowing them to create the characters "in a way that I never would have had the opportunity to do" if not for the pandemic protocols.[99] The safety measures cost approximately $9 million, including the hotel rooms. Jurassic World: Dominion was one of the first major films to resume production during the pandemic. Regarding COVID-19 safety, Universal considered the film ideal to resume as it required few real locations outside of the studio sets, and it had a relatively small cast and few extras. The earlier start of filming in England also made it easier to resume. The film served as an example for other major productions on how to resume during the pandemic.[93] Filming locations during July 2020 included Black Park, located adjacent to Pinewood Studios.[100] Neill, Dern and Goldblum began filming in early August 2020.[101][102][103] By that time, a total of four crew members in England had tested positive for COVID-19, and another four tested positive in Malta after arriving there ahead of production.[93][104] The first unit crew was to shoot in Malta with Pratt, Howard and Neill, but plans to film there were scaled back a few weeks prior to filming, after an increase there in positive COVID-19 cases. As a result of the rising cases, the United Kingdom added Malta to a list of countries in which people arriving from there must quarantine for 14 days.[105] Scenes set in Malta were rewritten by Trevorrow, and sets were reconfigured to continue with filming.[106] The actors were no longer part of the Malta shoot, which was instead handled by a second unit crew.[105] Filming in Malta was underway at the end of August 2020,[107][108] and continued into September.[105][109] Among the Maltese filming locations was the town of Floriana, where a car-crash scene was filmed.[109] The second unit also filmed establishing shots in Malta.[106] After the Malta shoot, filming continued at Pinewood Studios.[93][110] Because of the rescheduling caused by the pandemic delay, Trevorrow and Johnson had struggled to find an ideal time in Johnson's schedule for filming, as he was also set to resume production on Stumptown before it was canceled.[111][112] Filming was partially halted on October 7, 2020,[110] after several people tested positive for COVID-19. Although the individuals later tested negative, the film's safety protocols required a two-week quarantine period.[113] During the partial shutdown, the main cast members continued to film secondary sequences, before a full resumption of production later in the month.[110] Filming concluded on November 7, 2020, after nearly 100 days of shooting.[81] Release[edit] Theatrical[edit] Jurassic World: Dominion is scheduled to be released theatrically by Universal Pictures on June 10, 2022. The film was previously set for release on June 11, 2021, but it was delayed to the current date due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[114] Universal announced the new date on October 6, 2020, hoping to ensure a successful box-office performance, as well as to protect a big film that has a number of lucrative ancillary attachments. The delay was unrelated to production, as filming only had three weeks left at the time of the announcement.[115] Future[edit] Marshall clarified in May 2020 that Jurassic World: Dominion will not be the final film in the franchise and that it would instead mark "the start of a new era", in which humans have to adjust to dinosaurs being on the mainland.[116] References[edit] ^ "Michael Giacchino to Return for 'Jurassic World: Dominion'".
