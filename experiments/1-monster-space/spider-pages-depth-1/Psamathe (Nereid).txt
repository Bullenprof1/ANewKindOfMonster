She was the mother of Phocus by Aeacus[2] and later became the wife of Proteus.[3] By the latter, she gave birth to a son, Theoclymenus who became a king of Egypt, and a daughter, Theonoe (Eido). Some translations of Ovid have the name as Psamanthe.[4] In modern times[edit] Psamathe has a moon named after her. Notes[edit] ^ Robert Graves. The Greek Myths (1960) ^ Ovid.
