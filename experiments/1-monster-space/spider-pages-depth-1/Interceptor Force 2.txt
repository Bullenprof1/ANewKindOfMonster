Contents 1 Plot 2 Cast 3 Production 4 References 5 External links Plot[edit] Over Grozny, Russia, a pair of fighter jets chase down an unidentified spacecraft moving at supersonic speeds. Within minutes, it is the jets that are chased and eventually blasted out of the sky by the spacecraft. Minutes later, residents report a "meteor" flying past the city and landing somewhere in the distant hills. Jack Bavaro, head of the Alpha Force, calls in Lieutenant Sean Lambert, the sole survivor of the first Alpha mission four years ago in Mexico. Lambert's entire team was killed while trying to capture a single specimen of extraterrestrial life. Now Weber wants Lambert to take a new team of interceptors into Russia to capture this new alien specimen. Lambert and the Alpha Force fly to Grozny. The new team consists of science officer Dawn DeSilva and German Special Ops soldiers Bjorn Hatch, Nathan McAllister and Adriana Sikes. They find the wreckage of the alien spacecraft outside a Russian nuclear plant. Holes blasted in the razor fencing and thick concrete walls suggest the alien is inside. The Alpha Force enters the nuclear plant and seal off the exits, creating a trap for the alien. But then, one by one, the team is killed off by a creature that possesses a laser weapon, can change its appearance, and can also regenerate itself completely from a single piece of alien tissue. Additionally, the alien has found a way to explode all the uranium fuel rods in the nuclear plant to create a lethal radiation cloud over Europe that will quickly spread and cover the rest of the world. Lambert and the remaining Alpha Force have 60 minutes to save themselves, and the Earth, from nuclear doom. Cast[edit] Source[1] Actor Role Olivier Gruner Lieutenant Sean Lambert Roger R.
