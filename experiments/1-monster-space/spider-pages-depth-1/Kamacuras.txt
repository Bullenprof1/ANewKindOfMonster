Later, a radioactive accident that occurred due to a weather experiment mutated the insects and enlarged them further. Now the size of buildings, they became known as Kamacuras. Three Kamacuras find a giant egg and crack it open, finding a baby Godzilla inside. Before they could eat the infant, Godzilla arrived and attacked the insectoids, killing two of the Kamacuras while the third was killed by Kumonga. A fourth Kamacuras was later transferred to Monster Island as of the film Godzilla vs. Gigan. The Showa Kamacuras were 2 meters (6.5 feet) long prior to their mutation and 50 meters (164 feet) tall and weighed 2,800 metric tons (3,086 short tons) afterward.[2] Millennium[edit] In the live-action film Godzilla: Final Wars, an individual Kamacuras appears as one of the many mind-controlled monsters used by aliens called the Xiliens. It attacks Paris, France and causes damage to one of the Earth Defense Force (EDF)'s battleships until the Xiliens teleport it away to make Earth believe they had defeated the monsters. After the humans discover the Xiliens' true motives, the aliens dispatch their monsters to destroy Earth. Kamacuras battles Godzilla in Tokyo, but the latter causes a tidal wave that forces the former to flee and camouflage itself within a forest. Godzilla flushes out Kamacuras with its atomic breath, which the insectoid responds by charging Godzilla, who grabs Kamacuras and impales it on an electrical pylon. In the novelization, Godzilla instead crushes Kamacuras' head with its tail. The Final Wars Kamacuras is 40 meters (131 feet) tall, 90 meters (295 feet) long, and weighs 20,000 metric tons (22,046 short tons).[3] Reiwa[edit] In the anime film Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters, Kamacuras appears briefly in the opening sequence, as part of a late 20th century news report stating it was the first monster to appear and depicting it attacking Manhattan and destroying the World Trade Center. This is expanded upon in the prequel novel, Godzilla: Monster Apocalypse, in which Kamacuras attacked on May 4th, 1999 after emerging from the Upper New York Bay. Over the course of the succeeding 72 hours, the insectoid caused 2.3 million casualties and destroyed large swathes of New York and New Hampshire until the military killed it with bunker busters. Meanwhile, a smaller Kamacuras attacked train passengers in the East River before it was tricked into cutting an old steam pipe, which killed it. Powers[edit] In addition to its slashing forearm blades and the ability to fly, Kamacuras was shown in Final Wars as being able to blend in with its surroundings through a form of cuttlefish-like color changing ability.
