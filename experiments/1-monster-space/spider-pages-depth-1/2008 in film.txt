The entertainment agency website IGN described 2008 as "one of the biggest years ever for movies." It stated, "2008 was the year when the comic book movie genre not only hits its zenith, but also gained critical respectability thanks to The Dark Knight. Animated films also proved a huge draw for filmgoers, with Pixar's WALL-E becoming not only the highest grossing toon but also the most lauded. Things got off on the right foot with the monster movie madness of Cloverfield. Marvel got down to business laying the groundwork for their superhero team-up The Avengers with the blockbuster hit Iron Man and their respectable attempt at rebooting The Incredible Hulk. The games-to-film genre took a hit this year, with only Max Payne proving to be a worthy adaptation of the source material. We also saw the highly anticipated big-screen returns of iconic characters like Batman, James Bond, and Indiana Jones – some were more successful than others."[1] The film industry and review website IndieWire described 2008 as "a stellar year for movies" that "gave us tons of unforgettable classics" such as The Wrestler, 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days and Che.[2] Highest-grossing films[edit] See also: Lists of box office number-one films § 2008 The top 10 films released in 2008 by worldwide gross are as follows:[3] Highest-grossing films of 2008 Rank Title Distributor Worldwide gross 1 The Dark Knight Warner Bros. $997,000,000[4] 2 Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Paramount $790,653,942 3 Kung Fu Panda Paramount / DreamWorks $631,744,560 4 Hancock Sony Pictures / Columbia $629,443,428 5 Mamma Mia!

Worldwide, it grossed $997 million on its initial release,[4] and an IMAX reissue[6] in 2009 saw it become the fourth film to gross $1 billion at the global box office.[7][8] For 2008, the top ten films consisted of three superhero films, three animated films, three action films and one musical film. Mamma Mia! became the highest-grossing film in UK history until it was surpassed by Avatar in 2010.
