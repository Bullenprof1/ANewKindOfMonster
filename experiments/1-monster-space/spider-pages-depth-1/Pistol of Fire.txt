It was released in November 2004, in the UK and February 2005, in the United States. It is the only album by Kings of Leon to have a Parental Advisory label because of profanity in "Taper Jean Girl", "Rememo", "Soft", and "Four Kicks". The cover is reminiscent of Queen's A Night at the Opera. "The Bucket", "Four Kicks" and "King of the Rodeo" were released as singles in the UK.
