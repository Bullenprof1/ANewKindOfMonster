It stands in Aso Kujū National Park in Kumamoto Prefecture, on the island of Kyushu. Its peak is 1,592 meters (5,223 ft) above sea level. Mount Aso has a fairly large caldera (25 kilometers (16 miles) north-south and 18 km (11 mi) east-west) with a circumference of around 120 km (75 mi), although sources vary on the exact distance.

Neko, Mt. Taka, Mt. Naka (also called Nakadake or Naka-Dake), Mt. Eboshi, and Mt. Kishima. The highest point is the summit of Mt. Taka, at 1592 m above sea level. The crater of Mt. Naka, the west side of which is accessible by road, contains an active volcano which continuously emits smoke and has occasional eruptions. Only the northernmost crater (the first crater) has been active for the last 70 years—1974, 1979, 1984–1985, 1989–1991,[1] 2009, 2011, 2015[2] and 2016.[3][4] The present Aso Caldera formed as a result of four huge caldera eruptions occurring over a range of 90,000–300,000 years ago.[citation needed] The caldera, one of the largest in the world, contains the city of Aso as well as Takamori and Minamiaso enclosing the caldera extends about 18 km east to west and about 25 km north to south. Viewpoints from the somma overlooking the caldera are perched upon lava formed before the volcanic activity which created the present caldera. Ejecta from the huge caldera eruption 90,800 years ago covers more than 600 km3 and roughly equals the volume of Mount Fuji; it is presumed[by whom?] that the pyroclastic flow plateau covered half of Kyushu. History[edit] The eruption which formed the present somma occurred approximately 300,000 years ago. Four large-scale eruptions (Aso 1 – 4) occurred during a period extending from 300,000 to 90,000 years ago. As large amounts of pyroclastic flow and volcanic ash were emitted from the volcanic chamber, a huge depression (caldera) was formed as the chamber collapsed. The fourth eruption (Aso 4) was the largest, with volcanic ash covering the entire Kyushu region and even extending to Yamaguchi Prefecture. Mt. Taka, Mt. Naka, Mt. Eboshi, and Mt. Kishima are cones formed following the fourth above-mentioned huge caldera eruption. Mt. Naka remains active today. It is presumed[by whom?] that Mt. Neko is older than the fourth huge caldera eruption. Aso's pyroclastic flow deposits (welded tuff) were utilized for bridge construction in the region, There are approximately 320 arched stone bridges in Kumamoto Prefecture, including the Tsujun-kyo and Reitai-kyo bridges on the Midorikawa River, which are important national cultural properties.[1] Climate[edit] With an elevation of 1,143 metres (3,750 ft).,[5] Mount Aso has a climate that falls as humid continental (Köppen climate classification "Dfb"), with warm summers and cold winters. Precipitation is high throughout the year, which brings the area to have borderline subtropical characteristics as well. They are particularly heavy in June and July, where over 500 millimetres (20 in) of rain fell in each month.

A shuttle bus now runs to the crater's edge. At the foot of the mountain there are also various campsites, and horse riding at Kusasenrigahama.[6] Because Mount Aso is a volcano, there are many onsen hot springs in the area. There are two hot springs within the crater that are associated with Aso Kujū National Park.[citation needed] In popular culture[edit] In Ishirō Honda's kaiju films, Mount Aso is home to the giant pteranodon creature Rodan. In Rodan, the creature and its mate perish in the volcano's eruption.[7] See also[edit] Japan portal Mountains portal Volcanoes portal Geography portal List of volcanoes in Japan Aso Shrine Aso Volcano Museum References[edit] "Asosan".
