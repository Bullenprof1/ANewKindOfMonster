These include documentaries (often of questionable authenticity) and dramas, both of which rely heavily on travelogue and stock footage scenes (and sometimes fabricated scenes) of semi-nude native peoples performing exotic rituals and customs. In Hollywood trade magazines "goona-goona" was a descriptive word for films or photos showing women of color with bare breasts,[1] usually in a supposed spirit of ethnographic interest like National Geographic. The word goona-goona comes from the 1932 film Goona-Goona, An Authentic Melodrama of the Island of Bali by Andre Roosevelt and Armand Denis.[2] Supposedly "goona-goona" is an aphrodisiac or "love powder" made from a narcotic plant. In Indonesian, the word actually means a type of evil magic[3] or a love spell cast upon an unwilling victim.[4] Films[edit] Gow the Head Hunter (1928) Caïn, aventures des mers exotiques (1930) The Blonde Captive (1931) Ingagi (1931) Virgins of Bali (1932) Wild Women of Borneo (1932) Goona-Goona (1932) Inyaah, The Jungle Goddess a.k.a.
