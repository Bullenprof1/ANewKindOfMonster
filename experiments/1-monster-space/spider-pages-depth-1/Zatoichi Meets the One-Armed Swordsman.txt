Tōjin-ken), also known as Zatoichi Meets the One-Armed Swordsman, is a 1971 Japanese-Hong Kong chambara/wuxia crossover by Japanese film director Kimiyoshi Yasuda and Chinese film director Hsu Tseng Hung. The film stars Shintaro Katsu as the blind swordsman Zatoichi and Jimmy Wang Yu as the "One-Armed Swordsman" Wang Kang. It is a crossover of the long-running Zatoichi series and the One-Armed Swordsman film series. The Chinese edit of the film, known as 獨臂刀大戰盲俠 (pinyin: Dú Bì Dāo Dà Zhán Máng Xiá, jyutping: Duk6 Bei3 Dou1 Daai6 Zin3 Maang4 Hap6), reportedly had more wuxia content with scenes showing the One-Armed Swordsman walking across the tops of trees, and also featured a different ending where instead of Zatoichi it was Wang Kang who was victorious in the final duel, and without killing his opponent. Both versions were shown theatrically in Hawaii. It is unknown where prints of this alternate version reside.[1] Cast[edit] Shintaro Katsu as Zatoichi Jimmy Wang Yu as Wang Kang Yūko Hama as Osen Michie Terada as Oyone Kōji Nanbara as Kakuzen Tokue Hanasawa as Yosaku Shinsuke Minami as Henoichi Shirō Itō as Shinshichi Toru Abe as Boss Tōbei Cheung Yik as Li Xiangrong Wang Ling as Li Yumei References[edit] ^ Unseenfilms External links[edit] API at the Hong Kong Movie DataBase Zatoichi Meets The One-Armed Swordsman at Hong Kong Cinemagic Zatoichi Meets the One-Armed Swordsman at IMDb v t e Zatoichi by Kan Shimozawa Films The Tale of Zatoichi (1962) The Tale of Zatoichi Continues (1962) New Tale of Zatoichi (1963) Zatoichi the Fugitive (1963) Zatoichi on the Road (1963) Zatoichi and the Chest of Gold (1964) Zatoichi's Flashing Sword (1964) Fight, Zatoichi, Fight (1964) Adventures of Zatoichi (1964) Zatoichi's Revenge (1965) Zatoichi and the Doomed Man (1965) Zatoichi and the Chess Expert (1965) Zatoichi's Vengeance (1966) Zatoichi's Pilgrimage (1966) Zatoichi's Cane Sword (1967) Zatoichi the Outlaw (1967) Zatoichi Challenged (1967) Zatoichi and the Fugitives (1968) Samaritan Zatoichi (1968) Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo (1970) Zatoichi Goes to the Fire Festival (1970) Zatoichi and the One-Armed Swordsman (1971) Zatoichi at Large (1972) Zatoichi in Desperation (1972) Zatoichi's Conspiracy (1973) Zatoichi, Darkness Is His Ally (1989) Zatōichi (2003) Ichi (2008) Zatoichi: The Last (2010) Television series List of Zatoichi episodes (1974–1979) v t e Films directed by Kimiyoshi Yasuda The Young Swordsman (1954) The Dancer and Two Warriors (1955) The Young Lord (1955) 29-nin no Kenka-jō (1957) Hanataro Jumon (1958) Kaidan Kasane-ga-fuchi (1960) Zatoichi on the Road (1963) Adventures of Zatoichi (1964) Daimajin (1966) Zatoichi's Cane Sword (1967) Zatoichi and the Fugitives (1968) Yokai Monsters: Along with Ghosts (1969) Kaidan Kasane-ga-fuchi (1970) Zatoichi Meets the One-Armed Swordsman (1971) Zatoichi's Conspiracy (1973) This article related to a Hong Kong film of the 1970s is a stub.
