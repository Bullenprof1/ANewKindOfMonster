By Chrysaor, she became the mother of the monsters Geryon[2][3][4][5] and Echidna[6] while Chione was her daughter by the river-god of Egypt, Neilus.[7] Meanwhile, to Poseidon, she borne Minyas, founder of Minyan Orchomenus[8] and Cotys, a king of Maeonia was her child by Manes.[9] Mythology[edit] Callirhoe was the naiad who became the companion of Persephone when the daughter of Demeter was abducted by the lord of the dead, Hades.[10] She was one of the three ancestors of the Tyrians, along with Abarbarea and Drosera.[11] Legacy[edit] Jupiter's moon Callirrhoe is named after her.

Though Herbert Jennings Rose says simply that it is "not clear which parents are meant", Athanassakis, p. 44, says that Phorcys and Ceto are the "more likely candidates for parents of this hideous creature who proceeded to give birth to a series of monsters and scourges". The problem arises from the ambiguous referent of the pronoun "she" in line 295 of the Theogony. While some have read this "she" as referring to Callirhoe (e.g. Smith "Echidna"; Morford, p. 162), according to Clay, p. 159 n. 32, "the modern scholarly consensus" reads Ceto, see for example Gantz, p. 22; Caldwell, pp. 7, 46 295–303; Grimal, "Echidna" p. 143. ^ Servius Commentary on the Aeneid of Virgil, 4.250, ed. by Georgius Thilo ^ Tzetzes on Lycophron, Alexandra 875 ^ Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities Book 1.27.1.
