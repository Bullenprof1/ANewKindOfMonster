Pictures. Directed by Mike Mitchell,[5] it is a sequel to The Lego Movie (2014), the fourth film in the franchise following the releases of 2017's The Lego Batman Movie and The Lego Ninjago Movie. The film stars Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, Charlie Day, Alison Brie, Nick Offerman, and Will Ferrell reprising their roles from the previous film, while new cast members include Stephanie Beatriz, Tiffany Haddish, and Maya Rudolph. In the film, Emmet Brickowski attempts to rescue his friends from the Systar System, while dealing with a coming cataclysm known as "Armamageddon". Plans for a sequel began in 2014 and was announced to be in the works on February 3, 2014. It was announced a few months later that the film was being directed by Chris McKay while Phil Lord and Christopher Miller remained as writers and producers. The film since underwent many changes, such as rewrites, directors, and release dates. The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part was released in the United States and United Kingdom on February 8, 2019, in 3D, RealD 3D, Dolby Cinema, IMAX, IMAX 3D, and 4DX formats. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who commended its humor, animation, soundtrack, and voice acting, although some said it was not as "fresh" as the first film.[6][7] With a gross of over $192 million worldwide against a budget of $99 million, the film was the franchise's second box office disappointment after The Lego Ninjago Movie.[8][9][10][11] As a result of The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part’s disappointing box office reception, Warner Bros. sold the film rights of The Lego Movie franchise to Universal Pictures,[12] which was later set for a 5-year deal.[13] Contents 1 Plot 2 Cast 3 Production 3.1 Development 3.2 Writing 3.3 Casting 4 Music 4.1 Soundtrack 4.2 Score 5 Release 5.1 Marketing 5.1.1 Video game 5.1.2 Short films 5.2 Home media 5.3 Sets 6 Reception 6.1 Box office 6.2 Critical response 6.3 Accolades 7 Future 8 Notes 9 References 10 External links Plot[edit] Shortly after the invasion led by Lord Business in which Emmet destroys the Kragle using the Piece of Resistance, Duplo aliens arrive in the Lego universe and threaten destruction.[N 1] Emmet builds the aliens a heart as a token of friendship, but one eats it and demands more. Lucy and the Master Builders believe this to be an attack and retaliate, and the ensuing battle ravages Bricksburg. Five years later, the teenaged Finn has rebuilt Bricksburg as "Apocalypseburg". Within the Lego universe, they have been ravaged by repeated Duplo attacks, and several of their friends have gone missing in a search for the Duplo home planet. Emmet remains upbeat in stark contrast to Lucy and his friends, though he is troubled by visions of an imminent disaster he calls "armamageddon". A mini-doll called General Sweet Mayhem arrives and kidnaps all of Emmet's friends, taking them to the shape-shifting empress of the "Systar System", Queen Watevera Wa'Nabi. Wa'Nabi can seemingly brainwash Emmet's friends into accepting the joy of her world, and convinces Batman to marry her as a way to unite the Lego and Duplo worlds, but Lucy alone remains highly skeptical of her endgame. Back in Apocalypseburg, Emmet tries to convince the Master Builders to help him save Lucy and the rest of his friends, but they refuse to help, believing that he isn't tough enough to go through the Systar System. Emmet subsequently crafts a spaceship to pursue Mayhem by passing through the "Stairgate". The ship is heavily damaged and nearly collides with an asteroid field, but is saved in time by rugged adventurer Rex Dangervest. After hearing Emmet's story, Rex offers to help and takes them to the Systar System, and en route, Emmet tries to emulate some of Rex's mannerisms in an attempt to be tough. When they arrive, they quickly reunite with Lucy and learn of the marriage plans, which Rex insists must be a front to bring on "armamageddon". As the wedding starts, Emmet, Rex, and Lucy split up to sabotage the event. However, Lucy is intercepted by Mayhem, who insists the wedding is instead supposed to prevent "armamageddon". At the ceremony, Wa'Nabi reveals her true form: the heart that Emmett tried to give the Duplo invaders five years prior. Realizing that Mayhem is right, Lucy tries to stop Emmet, but Rex goads him into crashing the ceremony. In reality, Finn, after finding that Bianca had taken his Lego figures, has smashed her own creations. Emmet realizes his mistake, but is seized by Rex, who reveals he is a version of Emmet from the future. Rex had collided with the asteroids, and ended up under the dryer, forgotten by Finn. To ensure his future existence, he changed his appearance and created a time-travel machine to return to help Emmet but make sure "armamageddon" came to pass. When Emmet tries to fight back, Rex knocks him under the same dryer, ensuring that he would continue to exist. In the real world, Finn and Bianca's mother is fed up with the kids' bickering, and orders them to put the Lego toys into the storage bin; Lucy recognizes this as Emmet's "armamageddon" (as in "our mama gets in"). Both the Lego and Duplo figures are put into the Bin of Storage and fear they will not escape. While every Lego and Duplo figure sings about the awful situation they are now, Lucy, who refused to give up, sings to encourage everyone not to give up too. Finn hears the song from the Bin and opens it and sees Wa'Nabi in pieces, thinking of the day he gave the heart to Bianca when they were young. Finn rebuilds the heart, reconciles with her and start playing together. In the Lego universe, Lucy and the others escape the Bin and help rebuild both Apocalypseburg and Wa'Nabi's world. Lucy helps to save Emmet from Rex and destroys his time machine. Emmet comes to accept he will never be like Rex, and with this self-realization, a remorseful Rex fades from existence, correcting a time paradox. Finn and Bianca's mother sees them playing together, and has a change of heart. The Lego universe is recreated as a mish-mash of Apocalypseburg and the Systar System, renamed "Syspocalypstar". Lord Business appears to the characters, but is set aflame by Benny and runs into a store where he is blown up. Emmet's home is rebuilt, and the film ends with Lucy making Emmet a gift of the original album of "Everything Is Awesome", revealing that she co-originated the song, causing Emmet to gasp in shock.

Production[edit] Development[edit] On February 3, 2014, Jared Stern was hired to write the sequel, along with Michelle Morgan.[29] On March 12, 2014, Deadline reported that animation co-director Chris McKay would direct the sequel with Phil Lord and Christopher Miller as producers.[30] On April 10, 2014, it was reported that McKay wanted to have more women in the sequel than men.[31] On July 28, 2014, it was reported that Chris Pratt wanted to return to reprise his role as Emmet. It was also reported that Will Arnett might return to reprise his role as Batman, but hadn't decided.[32] In October 2014, Warner Bros. scheduled The Lego Batman Movie for 2017, and The Lego Movie 2 for May 25, 2018.[33][34] On October 25, 2014, it was reported that Lord and Miller had signed on to write The Lego Movie 2.[35] On October 30, it was announced that Australia-based animation studio Animal Logic was in talks to produce the next three Lego films (though the deal was not finalized at the time) and the New South Wales government would make financial contributions to all the films.[36] On November 12, during an interview with BBC News, Lord and Miller revealed that there would be more female characters featured in the film.[37] On February 24, 2015, the sequel was retitled The Lego Movie Sequel and Rob Schrab was announced as the film's director, replacing McKay as director as he was scheduled to direct The Lego Batman Movie instead.[38] By November 2015, Miller announced that the first draft of the script was completed.[39] Subsequent rewrites were provided by Raphael Bob-Waksberg,[40] Dominic Russo[41] and Matthew Fogel.[42] By February 2017, Schrab had been replaced by Mike Mitchell, reportedly due to "creative differences".[5] Production started in Canada on October 2, 2017.[43][44] In an interview with Collider, producer Dan Lin confirmed that Lord & Miller were rewriting the script during production. He also said that the sequel was going to include more songs due to the success of competing Disney musical films like Frozen and Moana.[45] The production of the film took advantage of Animal Logic's latest update to its trace renderer, Glimpse, to improve on-screen detail and depth-of-field.[46] The film is dedicated to Charie Miller, Christopher Miller's mother, who was born in July 1949 and died in December 2018, before the film was released.[47] Writing[edit] The Lego Movie 2's narrative starts after the events of the first film, just as Finn's toddler sister Bianca starts to play with Duplo blocks and tries to take over Bricksburg. In the intervening years, Bianca has taken more of the Lego sets to incorporate into her own creations. The animation team recognized that girls would likely not only use Lego bricks but also incorporate other materials, such as fabrics and paper, creating a challenge for their rendering team. They wanted these elements to appear as if a child was manipulating them through their stop-motion animation process. They explored multiple design styles for each playset that is within Bianca's room, the "Systar System", and developed new animation approaches for some of these styles, including using fewer frames as in inbetweening.[19] They also incorporated the Lego Friends line of toys aimed at girls, which include mini-dolls like General Sweet Mayhem. However, unlike traditional Lego mini-figurines, the Lego Friends' mini-dolls do not have the same articulation, for example, having no separate leg movement or wrists that rotate. The production team, working with Lego, did not want to create walking and movement patterns that did not match the articulation the real figurines could do, and came up with creative solutions for animating these in the film. This also created a challenge for at least one song and dance number; production brought in a choreographing team to help plan out the dance taking into account for the restrictions of movement for the mini-figures. For Queen Watevra Wa-Nabi, the production team decided to simply assign a pile of random Lego bricks for her, but required that each of the forms that she could shape-shift into used only those bricks from that pile.[19] According to Lord and Miller, each Lego Movie takes place in the imagination of a child. Miller explained that “we wanted to try and tell a more complicated and sophisticated version of that story, where we had two different imaginations coming together. And part of the fun of the movie is trying to figure out what's happening in the real world and how that's represented in the world of the Lego." With The Lego Movie 2, both Finn and Bianca's imaginations drive certain scenes, and the creators opted to leave parts of the film vague if the scene was based on Finn's version, Bianca's version or some combination.[20] Among the mini-figures within the film is one based on Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Lord and Miller had considered figures that would be unexpected within the film, with Ginsburg as one of their ideas. They received Ginsburg's blessing for this appearance, though she did not perform any voice work for this role. Subsequently, the Ginsburg mini-figure would then be made as part of the movie's toy line.[48][49] Casting[edit] On March 23, 2018, it was reported that Tiffany Haddish had been cast in the film to voice a new lead character, while returning actors would be Chris Pratt as Emmet, Elizabeth Banks as Wyldstyle, Will Arnett as Batman, Channing Tatum as Superman, and Jonah Hill as Green Lantern.[14] Stephanie Beatriz and Arturo Castro were announced to be part of the film on June 4, 2018.[16] Castro was replaced by Richard Ayoade in the final film. During San Diego Comic Con 2018, it was announced that Pratt would also voice a new character in addition to Emmet, Rex Dangervest, who is based after Pratt himself.[15] In November 2018, Maya Rudolph joined the cast.[21] In early January 2019, it was revealed that Jason Momoa would reprise his role as Aquaman from the DC Extended Universe. Gal Gadot was to also reprise her role as Wonder Woman from the DC Extended Universe, replacing Cobie Smulders from the previous film,[50] but Smulders ended up returning shortly before the film's release.[23] Daniel Radcliffe was originally set to voice a look-alike of his Harry Potter known as Larry Potter, but his scene was ultimately cut. It was revealed by Mike Mitchell that Radcliffe's cameo was deleted due to not wanting to risk anything that would upset the Harry Potter fandom. The character was replaced by Larry Poppins (another look-alike character based on a British media icon).[51] Music[edit] Following the attempt to create an earworm with the first film's "Everything Is Awesome", the producers of the film created a similar song for the sequel, titled "Catchy Song", which principally features as its only lyric the repeated phrase "This song's gonna get stuck inside your head". The song was written by Jon Lajoie, and performed by its producer, Dillon Francis, featuring T-Pain and Lay Lay. According to Lajoie, he found that "Everything is Awesome" was "annoyingly catchy", and the only way that they could outdo that was "Dial the 'annoying' up to 11!".[52] Mark Mothersbaugh, who composed the first film's soundtrack, as well as the score for The Lego Ninjago Movie, returned to compose the score for the sequel.[53] Soundtrack[edit] The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) Soundtrack album by Various artists Released February 7, 2019 Recorded 2018 Genre Film soundtrack Length 23:51 Label WaterTower Music No. Title Writer(s) Performer(s) Length 1.

Reception[edit] Box office[edit] The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part grossed $105.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $86.5 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $192.3 million.[4] In the United States and Canada, The Lego Movie 2 was released alongside What Men Want, Cold Pursuit and The Prodigy, and was originally projected to gross $50–55 million from 4,303 theaters in its opening weekend.[82] The film made $1.5 million from Thursday night previews, and when combined with advance screenings held at 550 theaters on January 26, 2019, made a total preview gross of $2.1 million. After making $8.5 million on its first day, weekend estimates were lowered to $31 million. It went to debut to $34.1 million, finishing first at the box office but marking a 50% decline from the first film. Deadline Hollywood attributed the low opening to franchise fatigue due to the release of two spin-offs prior to The Lego Movie 2, as well as Warner Bros. promoting the film using similar marketing tactics from the first film, leading audiences to assume the sequel to be derivative and indistinguishable from its predecessor.[83][84] Critical response[edit] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 84% based on 294 reviews, with an average rating of 7.00/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "While it isn't quite as much fun as its predecessor, The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part fits neatly into an animated all-ages franchise with heart and humor to spare."[85] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[86] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A–" on an A+ to F scale (down from the first film's "A"), while those at PostTrak gave it an average 4 out of 5 stars; social media monitor RelishMix noted online responses to the film were "great".[83] Jesse Hassenger of The A.V. Club called the film "lovable", giving it a grade of B and writing "Like Brad Bird's recent Incredibles 2, it follows up a dazzling animated original (all the more dazzling for earning that designation despite being based on a toy line) with some big ideas that don't cohere with the same streamlined magic as its predecessor."[87] TheWrap's Yolanda Machado commended the screenplay and directing and wrote that the film "expands on the original's premise, adding new worlds and characters to the growing LEGO universe, while also crafting a story that is timely, inventive, hilarious and perfect for all ages."[88] Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly says that while it was better than most other films it didn't recapture the surprise of the first film, saying "Everything is still awesome. Just a little bit less so."[89] For The Hollywood Reporter, Michael Rechtshaffen wrote that the film brought "little that's fresh or funny to the interlocking brick table despite boasting a script penned by originators Phil Lord and Christopher Miller."[7] Accolades[edit] List of awards and nominations Award Date of ceremony Category Recipient(s) Result Ref.

Lego has later entered in negotiations with Universal Pictures for a new first-look deal. Dan Lin is expected to remain as producer through his company Rideback.[12] In April 2020, the deal with Universal was set for a 5-year film deal.[13] Notes[edit] ^ As depicted at the ending of the 2014 film The Lego Movie. ^ Features Batman (1989) theme composed by Danny Elfman.
