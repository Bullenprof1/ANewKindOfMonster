Bandai America Inc. was established as local US sales/marketing operation in 1978. Spacewarp, a line of build-it-yourself toy rolling ball "roller coasters" was introduced by Bandai in the 1980s. In May 1980, Makoto Yamashina, son of the founder, became president of Bandai. Naoharu Yamashina became chairman of the board. Upon his arrival, Makoto Yamashina completely changed the aging staff of Bandai and replaced it with young employees with the intent of not only bringing new ideas but also revisiting the strategy of the group. The new president took a different commercial approach by selling directly to retailers rather than going through intermediates.[4][6] In July 1980, Bandai launched the Gundam Plastic Model based on the animated series which gave birth to the Gunpla series.[13][14] In November, the subsidiary Celent was created.[6] Bandai became one of the first third-party developers for the Nintendo Family Computer in 1985.[15] Among its first titles was Tag Team Match: MUSCLE, a video game adaptation of the Kinnikuman manga, which sold over one million copies.[6] Bandai also produced the Family Trainer Pad, released outside Japan as the Power Pad, which also performed well commercially. A series of games was released both in the US and in Japan, including Athletic World and Stadium Events for the NES. Shortly after its release, Nintendo purchased the rights to the FFF mat in North America, replacing it with their own redesign, the Power Pad. In order to maintain branding continuity, Stadium Events was pulled from shelves after a short period of availability at Woolworth's stores. Because the game was pulled from shelves and discontinued before many copies were sold, Bandai's Stadium Events is universally accepted as the rarest licensed NES game released in North America.[16][17] A shrink wrapped copy of the game sold for $41,270 on eBay in February 2010.[18] The sister game to Stadium Events, called Athletic World was initially released with a label that indicated compatibility with the Family Fun Fitness mat, but was later re-released with an updated label that mentions the Power Pad instead.[19] Stadium Events was not released by name again, but instead was slightly modified and relaunched as the Power Pad pack-in game, World Class Track Meet. Since the 1980s, Bandai has become the leading toy company of Japan, and to this day, has the main toy licenses in Japan to popular properties including Daikaiju, Ultraman, Super Robot, Kamen Rider, the Super Sentai and Power Rangers series (which it took part in creating), Gundam, and many others. In February 1989, it acquired arcade game developer Coreland and reorganized it into Banpresto, which became Bandai's coin-operated entertainment division.[20] In the early 1990s, Bandai published games for Nintendo in the United Kingdom, including Street Fighter II on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.[21] In January 1997, Bandai announced it would merge its operations with Japanese video game developer Sega.[22][23][24] The merge, a $1 billion stock swap where Sega would acquire Bandai and dissolve the company,[22] would have established a new entertainment conglomerate named Sega Bandai Ltd. with an estimated $6 billion in revenue.[25] The announcement followed a ¥9 billion loss from Bandai the same month, attributed to declining game sales and the poor reception of the Apple Pippin console.[22] Bandai felt Sega was an appropriate company to merge with, as it possessed an American-esc management and several international offices, in addition to owning several successful franchises like Sonic the Hedgehog.[22][25] Opposition arose within Bandai's employees and midlevel executives, as neither felt the company's family-friendly work ethic clashed well with Sega's top-down corporate culture.[26] As a result, Bandai called off the merge in May before its finalization in October.[27] President Makoto Yamashina took responsibility for its failure, publicly apologizing and resigning his position within the company.[28] Bandai instead agreed to a business alliance with Sega.[26] After its merger with game developer and amusement facility operator Namco in 2005, Bandai Company is now under the management and a member of Bandai Namco Holdings (Bandai Namco Group). Following a group reorganisation in 2006, Bandai heads the group's Toys and Hobby Strategic Business Unit (SBU).[29] Bandai Entertainment announced it would cease its distribution operations in January 2012.[30][31] Beez Entertainment is no longer releasing new anime in Europe.[32] In February 2018, Saban Brands and Bandai's US division jointly announced a mutual agreement to not renew their Power Rangers master toy license, effective Spring 2019, after which competing toy company Hasbro will inherit the license. This transition will not affect Bandai Japan's Super Sentai master toy license with Toei. A sister company, Bandai Spirits, was established on 15 February 2018. On 1 April 2018, the division of Bandai Co., Ltd that dealt with products for adult customers (including figures and plastic models) as well as Banpresto's prizes business were transferred over to Bandai Spirits.[33] Corporate structure[edit] Bandai's headquarters is in Taitō, Tokyo, Japan. The company owns offices in the United States (Bandai America), in Mexico (Bandai Corporacion Mexico), in the United Kingdom (Bandai UK), and in France, Spain, Taiwan, and mainland China. In the past, it owned offices in Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand, Germany, and East Asia, which acted as distributors for Bandai products in their respective countries. Bandai is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bandai Namco Holdings and heads its parent's Toy and Hobby Content Strategic Business Unit (CSBU). Bandai is among the largest and most profitable toy companies worldwide, alongside Mattel and Hasbro. The company focuses on creating unique and innovative products for its consumers, and to bend established conventions within the industry; its slogan, "Break out of the box" was made in reference to this.[34] Subsidiaries of Bandai[edit] The Bandai Hobby Center in Aoi-ku, Shizuoka Bandai Spirits Co., Ltd. produces figurines and plastic models targeted towards older demographics, utilizing popular licenses such as Mobile Suit Gundam, One Piece, Pokémon, Kirby, Hatsune Miku, Demon Slayer, Ultraman, and My Hero Academia. Bandai produces confectioneries, board games, and capsule toys through its subsidiary MegaHouse Corporation, which also releases toys and figurines under its MegaToy label. MegaHouse also holds the license for the Rubik's Cube in Japan, and has created multiple variations of the toy specifically for Japanese audiences. Manga series, television shows, and character-themed products are created by the Plex subsidiary.[35] Bandai Namco Collectables LLC, a division of Bandai America, imports and distributes Bandai-produced collectible figures across the United States. Products are often distributed through Bandai Logipal Inc. and Logipal Express Inc., divisions that also provide product inspection and manufacturing support, customs brokerage, and services relating to amusement facilities.[citation needed] See also[edit] Japan portal Tokyo portal Companies portal Bandai Museum Notes[edit] ^ Japanese: 株式会社バンダイ, Hepburn: Kabushiki gaisha Bandai ^ Japanese: 株式会社万代屋商店, Hepburn: Kabushiki-gaisha Bandai-ya References[edit] ^ "Bandai Group Establishes 'Bandai Channel' to Distribute Broadband Content".
