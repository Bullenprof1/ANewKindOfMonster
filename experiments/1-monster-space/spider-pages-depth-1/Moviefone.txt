In 1999, AOL purchased Moviefone for $388 million.[4][5] The acquisition was completed on May 21, 1999.[6][7] In 2001, Moviefone entered into a partnership with MovieTickets.com that crosslinked their ticketing offerings; by 2004, Moviefone's online arm was acquired outright by MovieTickets.com.[8] However, in 2012, Moviefone announced a partnership with MovieTickets.com's rival Fandango.[9][10] On February 23, 2014, it was reported that Moviefone would be shutting down its call-in service and its "777-FILM" phone number, but would maintain its mobile app services.[11] On May 5, 2014, Moviefone was relaunched with a new look, an expansion into TV content, and a comprehensive search tool that allows users to find theaters, channels, and streaming services offering movies and television shows.[12] On April 5, 2018, Helios and Matheson Analytics, the majority owner of the movie ticketing service MoviePass, announced the acquisition of Moviefone from Oath Inc. for $1 million in cash and $8 million in stock.[13][14] In early 2020, the company's parent company went bankrupt and it was reported that it was being run by just a single employee. The company was worth just $4,379,504, or about 1% of the 388 million when it was purchased by AOL.[15] Made in Hollywood Producer Cleveland O’Neal III purchased Moviefone out of bankruptcy in March 2020 via his holding company, Born in Cleveland LLC.[16] In popular culture[edit] In the Seinfeld episode The Pool Guy, the character Cosmo Kramer receives misdialed calls meant for Moviefone after getting a new phone number. In the 2001 film Josie and the Pussycats, Mr. Moviefone is the voice of subliminal advertising messages planted into pop music by an ominous record agency. References[edit] ^ "About Moviefone".
