Amphiptere by Edward Topsell (1608) An Amphiptere (also called Amphithere, Amphitere, or Phipthere; meaning bi-winged, two-winged) is a type of winged serpent found in European heraldry.[1] Contents 1 Appearance 2 Usage 3 Modern fiction 4 References Appearance[edit] A heraldic amphiptere Amphipteres generally were said to have light-colored feathers like a sunrise, a serpentine body similar to a lindworm, bat-like green wings with feathered bone, and a long tail much like a wyvern's. Others are described as entirely covered in feathers with a spiked tail, bird-like wings, and a beak-like snout. Even more uncommon is the description of one with legs.[citation needed] Usage[edit] Amphipteres saw infrequent use as heraldic devices. Amphipteres are present on the arms of the House of Potier, which depict a bendlet purpure between two amphipteres or. The Potier heraldry also uses amphipteres as supporters, as do those of the Duke of Tresmes and Duke of Gesvres.[2] Modern fiction[edit] Amphitheres feature in the Dragonology series of books, which employ a conceit that dragons are real.[3] It also appears in Dracopedia: A Guide to Drawing the Dragons of the World.[citation needed] Amphitheres also appear in other modern fictional works.
