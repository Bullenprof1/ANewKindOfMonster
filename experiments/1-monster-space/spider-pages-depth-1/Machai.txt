They were accompanied in battlefields by other deities and spirits associated with war and death, such as Ares, Phobos, Deimos, the Keres, Polemos, Enyo, and their mother Eris. Popular culture[edit] The Machai make an appearance in Wrath of the Titans as Hades and later Cronus' troops. The Machai are similar to the Moliones, with coal black skin, two legs, six arms, two-headed and two torsos back to back with each other which enables them to attack more than one person. In The Blood of Olympus, Asclepius used the Machai (In this they are the twin children of Ares and Aphrodite, Phobos and Deimos), the curse of Delos (Which is actually one of the small yellow flowers that Delos sprouted upon the birth of Artemis and Apollo), and the Pylosian Mint in order to formulate a physician's cure. (The two brothers also appear in "The Demigod Files", but not by the name Machai.) In the top down ARPG Titan Quest: Immortal Throne, Makhai are enemies, that can be found in the final world of the game, "Hades". References[edit] ^ Hesiod, Theogony 226 ff ^ Shield of Heracles 139 ff
