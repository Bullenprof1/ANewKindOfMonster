First appearance Godzilla vs. Megalon (1973) Last appearance Godzilla: Rulers of Earth (2013–2015) Created by Jun Fukuda Tomoyuki Tanaka Shinichi Sekizawa Portrayed by Hideto Odachi In-universe information Species Giant beetle Megalon (メガロ, Megaro) is a kaiju who first appeared in Toho's 1973 film Godzilla vs. Megalon.[1] Contents 1 Overview 2 Appearances 2.1 Films 2.2 Television 2.3 Video games 2.4 Literature 3 References Overview[edit] Megalon is a bipedal, humanoid, burrowing insect resembling a beetle, standing 55 meters (180 feet) tall and weighing 40,000 metric tons (44,092 short tons), and the god of the subterranean nation of Seatopia. While Megalon possesses limited intelligence (he must be led to his destination by the protagonists' robot, Jet Jaguar), he makes up for it with his strength. Megalon possess two drill-like front appendages, which it uses both for burrowing and as weapons, and a set of wings usually covered by a beetle-like shell. The creature can fly, burrow, and swim at high speeds.[2] Unlike most kaiju under fire from humans who prevail with brute force, Megalon uses retreat and ambush tactics to defeat human forces in his first encounter. Megalon also has a horn (similar to a rhinoceros beetle) from which it can fire lightning-like bolts of electricity and it is capable of spitting fire bombs from its mouth. In Godzilla vs. Megalon, Megalon is worshipped as a deity by the people of the subterranean kingdom known as Seatopia. The Seatopians unleash Megalon on the surface world as revenge for the damage caused to Seatopia through reckless nuclear testing. During his assault on the surface world, Megalon comes into conflict with Godzilla and Jet Jaguar. Megalon returns in Godzilla: Monster Apocalypse, a prequel novel to Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters. Megalon appeared on the West coast of Africa on 2012 and crossed the continent, destroying countless nations, and disappeared into the Mozambique Channel. The casualties were reported to be 20 million casualties, including the wounded. Shortly after Megalon's attack across Africa, millions of refugees fled to Europe and the Middle East due to civil wars across the continent, this also lead to another incident such as Gezora attacking refugees in the Mediterranean Sea and a dispute between refugees and locals in Egypt that lead to a second civil war. Megalon returned 10 years later, attacking South Africa, forcing humanity to abandon the continent. In Godzilla: Project Mechagodzilla, a prequel novel to Godzilla: City on the Edge of Battle, 7 years later, Megalon moves to Asia. It annihilates India and Pakistan, both of whom just recovered from a nuclear war against each other. After destroying the Philippines, Megalon moved to the Ryukyu Archipelago. Megalon couldn't cause massive damage to Okinawa because King Caesar, a guardian deity of the island, emerged from Cape Manzamo and intercepted Megalon, both monsters died in the battle.
