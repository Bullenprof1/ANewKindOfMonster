The website's name, in fact, is a play on the term Joe Blow, and registered users of the website are known as 'schmoes'. In addition to JoBlo's own reviews, the site also features movie trailers, film scripts, previews of upcoming movies and interviews. The site was referenced in Entertainment Weekly as one of their "25 favorite online entertainment sites"[2] and Garabedian is quoted in publications such as USA Today. By the 2000s, Joblo.com was quoted on movie posters, DVD/Blu-ray covers and in commercials.[3] In 2001, the site started holding an annual awards presentation for films that were most enjoyed by its visitors. These became known as "The Golden Schmoes".[4] Often the winners of these awards were films that had large fan-bases, but limited critical praise. A book, JoBlo.com Presents... the 50 Coolest Movies of All Time[5] was released in 2002, featuring a foreword by film director Kevin Smith. In February 2009, JoBlo.com started a weekly podcast called The Good, The Bad, and The JoBlo Movie Podcast. Guests have included Bobcat Goldthwait, Duncan Jones, and Clifton Collins, Jr.. In 2009, JoBlo.com started a social networking site called Movie Fan Central. It closed down in 2018, alongside JoBlo.com's message board.[6] Golden Schmoes Awards[edit] The Golden Schmoes Awards have been held annually since 2001.
