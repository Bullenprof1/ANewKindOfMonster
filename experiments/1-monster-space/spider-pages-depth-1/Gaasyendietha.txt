Gaasyendietha, according to Seneca mythology, is a dragon that dwells in the deep areas of rivers and lakes of Canada, especially Lake Ontario. This dragon could fly on a trail of fire, and it could also spew fire.[1][2][3] It is also known as the 'meteor dragon', in reference to its supposed origin from a meteoroid that had impacted the Earth. It is also capable of crossing the heavens on a trail of fire.[4] In the tale "Ganyadjigowa", the hero Ganyadjigowa (The Mudhen) was killed by Gaasyendietha, in the form of an old man.[5] References[edit] ^ "Sea Serpents of Canada" Archived 2011-07-13 at the Wayback Machine, Charles Alexander Moffat. ^ The Serene Dragon Archived 2007-01-04 at the Wayback Machine. ^ Darek Isaacs (2010).
