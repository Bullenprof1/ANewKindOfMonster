For the ancient Greek musician, see Herodorus of Megara. Herodorus (Ancient Greek: Ἡρόδωρος), also called Herodorus of Heraclea (Ancient Greek: Ἡρόδωρος ὁ Ἡρακλεώτης)[1] was a native of Heraclea Pontica[2] and wrote a history on Heracles around 400 BC.[3] Plutarch references Herodorus several times in his account of Theseus in Parallel Lives. He should not be confused with Herodotus.
