Doll with a large head on a spring Not to be confused with Action figure. A bobblehead, also known as a nodder or wobbler, is a type of collectible doll. Its head is often oversized compared to its body. Instead of a solid connection, its head is connected to the body by a spring or hook[1] in such a way that a light tap will cause the head to move around, or bobble, hence the name.

Prompting their resurgence were cheaper manufacturing processes, and the main bobblehead material switched, this time from ceramic to plastic. It was now possible to make bobbleheads in the limited numbers necessary for them to be viable collectibles. On August 2, 1997, the minor league Birmingham Barons gave away Barons Bobblehead Doll bobbleheads at a game.[12] The first major league baseball team to offer a bobblehead giveaway was the San Francisco Giants, which distributed 35,000 Willie Mays head nodders at their May 9, 1999 game.[1] The variety of bobbleheads has grown to include even relatively obscure popular culture figures and notable people.[13][14] The new millennium brought a new type of bobblehead toy, the mini-bobblehead, two or three inches tall and used for free gifts in some package foods. Post Cereals packaged 22 million mini-bobble heads of MLB players with its cereal before opening day in 2002.[15] [2] On November 18, 2014, it was announced that the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum would open in 2016 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, US. The National Bobblehead HOF and Museum held a preview exhibit at RedLine Milwaukee from January 7, 2016 to April 30, 2016,[16] which showcased the largest public display of bobbleheads in history.[17] The 2000s also saw the rise of a competitive market for personalized, on-demand bobbleheads, typically 6–7 inches tall, from a number of on-line vendors.[18] In 2015, the Pope Francis bobblehead became so popular that a nationwide shortage was reported.[19] January 7, 2015 was the inaugural National Bobblehead Day in the US.[20] In 2016, the Guinness Book of World Records mark for world's largest bobblehead was set at 15 feet tall. Named "Goldie", it was the result of a collaboration between Dino Rentos and BobbleHeads.com.[21] Thanjavur dolls of India[edit] Main article: Tanjore doll Thanjavur bobblehead doll Thanjavur dolls are a type of Indian bobblehead dolls known as "Thanjavur Thalayatti Bommai" in the Tamil language, meaning "Tanjore Head-Shaking Doll". They are a native art form in the Thanjavur region of Tamil Nadu. These dolls are usually 6" to 12" tall (15 to 30 cm). They are made of clay or wood and painted over in bright colors, and are often dressed up in fancy clothes.[22] They form a part of an elaborate display of dolls known as "Golu (kolu)", exhibited in Indian houses during the "Dasara (Navaratri)" festival in Sep-Oct.[23] In popular culture[edit] Sports teams sometimes give away bobblehead dolls at their games; for example, the Los Angeles Kings gave away bobbleheads commemorating Luc Robitaille’s induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame.[24] In the 1986 "Let's Go Mets" music video, there is a scene where Joe Piscopo, standing outside the New York Mets' dugout at Shea Stadium, taps four Mets bobblehead dolls, then goes into the dugout and taps the heads of four actual Mets players (Howard Johnson, Bob Ojeda, Rick Aguilera, Kevin Mitchell) who "bobble" their heads in a similar fashion. Piscopo then attempts to tap a fifth player (Lee Mazzilli) but is rebuffed and subsequently tackled by all of the players.[25] In 2001, Audi broadcast commercials in Europe featuring an Elvis impersonator and a prototypical Wackel-Elvis ("Wobble Elvis" or "Wobbly Elvis") dashboard figure with a wobbling left arm and hip. Due to subsequent demand 165,000 Wackel-Elvis dashboard figures were produced. The figure depicts Elvis wearing the jumpsuit he wore in the 1973 Aloha from Hawaii TV broadcast.[26][27][28] Since 2003, American law journal The Green Bag has issued bobblehead dolls depicting Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, both past and present.[29] In the season two episode "Valentine's Day" of NBC’s The Office (U.S. TV Series), Dwight is given a bobblehead doll of himself as a Valentine's gift, from Angela.[30] In 2010, 14-year-old Henry Ermer of Brooklyn, New York, attempted to enter the Guinness Book of World Records by building what is believed to be the world's largest bobblehead, standing 16 feet tall.[31] On the 2012 season premiere episode of ABC's The Bachelorette, contestant Chris Bukowski presented bachelorette Emily Maynard with custom bobbleheads of the two of them in an attempt to impress her and further himself in the competition.[32] Bobbleheads are also a known characteristic feature of the videogame Fallout series Nowadays, Customized bobbleheads are designed based on a person's picture and given in the form of gifts on various occasions.
