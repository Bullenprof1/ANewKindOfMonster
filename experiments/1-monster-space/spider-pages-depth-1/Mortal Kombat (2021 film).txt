The film stars Lewis Tan, Jessica McNamee, Josh Lawson, Tadanobu Asano, Mehcad Brooks, Ludi Lin, Chin Han, Joe Taslim, and Hiroyuki Sanada. Following the critical and commercial failure of the 1997 film Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, a third Mortal Kombat film languished in development hell for a period of nearly two decades. In late 2010, Warner Bros. Pictures, which parent company, Warner Bros. Entertainment, acquired the franchise from Midway Games in 2009, began developing a new film, with Kevin Tancharoen serving as director from a script written by Uziel in the wake of their Mortal Kombat: Rebirth short film. James Wan was announced as a producer in August 2015 and McQuoid was hired as director in November 2016. Production took place at Adelaide Studios in Adelaide and at other locations in South Australia. Principal photography occurred from September to December 2019. Mortal Kombat was theatrically released internationally on April 8, 2021, and scheduled to be released by Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema in the United States on April 23, 2021, simultaneously in theaters and on the HBO Max streaming service.

The only survivor is Hanzo's infant daughter who is taken away by an Elder god named Lord Raiden, the protector of Earthrealm. In the present day, the forces of Outworld have won nine consecutive Mortal Kombat tournaments with just one more victory needed in the next tournament to conquer Earthrealm. Outworld sorcerer and second-in-command of Emperor Shao Kahn, Shang Tsung, orders his warriors Mileena, Reiko, Nitara, and Kabal to seek out and eliminate Earthrealm's champions, who bear a dragon mark, in order to ensure that Earthrealm has no chance in the upcoming tournament. Cole Young, a former MMA fighter and a bearer of the dragon mark, is attacked by Bi-Han, now going by the codename Sub-Zero. Cole and his wife and daughter are rescued by Special Forces major Jax, who also has a dragon mark. Jax tells Cole to seek out his partner Sonya Blade while he stays behind to fend off Sub-Zero; in the process, Sub-Zero incapacitates Jax by shattering his arms. Cole meets Sonya at her hideout where he finds out about the history of the Mortal Kombat and learns that the dragon mark can be transferred by killing its bearer. Sonya has captured Kano, an Australian mercenary of the Black Dragon clan, who had previously killed a champion with the dragon mark, which had moved onto Kano's body. Sonya, however, does not have the mark. The hideout is attacked by a reptilian creature which Kano kills by ripping its heart out. Cole, Sonya, and Kano travel to Raiden's Temple, which has traditionally been the training ground for Earthrealm's warriors. They are met there by Shaolin warriors Liu Kang and his partner Kung Lao and also encounter Raiden himself. They also find Jax there, who now has a set of inadequate mechanical arms. Raiden reveals to Cole that he is a descendant of Hanzo Hasashi, through Hanzo's daughter, and that he can use Hanzo's rope dart to reawaken the ancient ninja. Liu Kang and Kung Lao explain that every Earthrealm warrior with a dragon mark has a special power known as an "arcana", such as Liu Kang's ability to conjure fire. Therefore, the warriors at the Temple must find and awaken their arcanas if they are to stand a chance in Mortal Kombat. While Kano awakens his arcana, Cole is unable to do so. Realizing that Cole would be vulnerable for Outworld's forces, he allows him to leave despite the champions concerns. Shang Tsung and his warriors attempts to assault the temple but Raiden conjures an energy shield to keep them out. Kabal, being a former rival of Kano, persuades the latter to defect and lower the shield. Shang Tsung's warriors attack, killing Kung Lao and trapping Sonya under rubble. Jax's arcana awakens, powering up his arms, and giving him the opportunity to save Sonya. Cole is attacked by Outworld champion Goro. When Cole's wife and daughter are threatened by the four-armed brute, his arcana awakens, giving him a suit of armour and a set of tonfas. With his newfound arcana, Cole kills Goro and rejoins the others at the temple. Cole proposes splitting up Outworld's warriors and taking them out individually. Agreeing to the plan, Raiden transports Earthrealm's champions to each of Outworld's warriors, and Earthrealm's fighters kill their opponents in one-on-one battles; Sonya kills Kano during this process and gains his dragon mark, awakening her own arcana: the ability to fire purple energy blasts. Outworld's remaining fighter, Sub-Zero, abducts Cole's family and goads him into a fight. Cole is initially overpowered by Sub-Zero until his blood touches Hanzo's rope dart. Hanzo is resurrected as the undead ninja Scorpion and, with Cole's assistance, battles Sub-Zero and kills him. Scorpion then departs back to the Netherrealm, thanking Cole for bringing him back. While the battle is won, Shang Tsung declares that he is undeterred by these setbacks and that the Mortal Kombat tournament will proceed as expected. Raiden orders Earthrealm's warriors to find more champions to fight in the tournament and help defend Earthrealm. Meanwhile, Cole sets off for Los Angeles to recruit Hollywood superstar Johnny Cage.

Bennett Walsh, and director Simon McQuoid serve as producers for the reboot. In 1997, Robin Shou's original Mortal Kombat contract was a three-picture deal,[11] and Threshold Entertainment's production on a second sequel was initially scheduled to commence shortly after the release of Annihilation, but it was shelved due to Annihilation's poor reception and disappointing box-office performance. Attempts to produce a third film since then have remained stuck in development hell with numerous script rewrites and storyline, cast, and crew changes. A November 2001 poll on the official Mortal Kombat website hosted by Threshold asked fans which characters they believed would die in the third movie.[12] The 2005 destruction of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina greatly affected one of the film's planned shooting locations.[13] In June 2009, a bankruptcy court lawsuit saw Lawrence Kasanoff suing Midway Games while mentioning that a third film was in the works. Warner Bros. Pictures (which became the parent of New Line Cinema in 2008, after over a decade of both operating as separate divisions of Time Warner) ended up purchasing most of Midway's assets, including Mortal Kombat.[14] In 2010, director Kevin Tancharoen released an eight-minute short film titled Mortal Kombat: Rebirth,[15] made as a pitch to Warner Bros. Pictures of a reboot of the Mortal Kombat film franchise.[16] In September 2011, New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. announced that Tancharoen was hired to direct a new feature-length film from a screenplay by Mortal Kombat: Rebirth writer Oren Uziel,[17] with the intention of aiming for an R rating.[18] Shooting was expected to begin in March 2012 with a budget projected at between $40–50 million[19] and a release date of 2013.[20][21] However, the project was ultimately delayed due to budget constraints, and Tancharoen began working on the second season of the web series Mortal Kombat: Legacy until problems with the film had been sorted out, but he quit the film production in October 2013.[22] James Wan signed on as the film's producer in August 2015.[23] Simon McQuoid was hired as director in November 2016, marking his feature directorial debut, with Greg Russo writing the script.[24][25] Russo tweeted in February 2019 that the film's script was complete.[25] In May 2019, it was announced that the film had entered pre-production and would be shot in South Australia,[26] with a release date of March 5, 2021.[27] Russo tweeted in July 2019 that the film would indeed have an R rating and that the games' Fatalities would "finally be on the big screen".[28] Casting[edit] Joe Taslim was the first actor cast for the production in July 2019, as Bi-Han, the first Sub-Zero.[29][30] In August, Mehcad Brooks, Tadanobu Asano, Sisi Stringer, and Ludi Lin were cast in the roles of Jax, Raiden, Mileena, and Liu Kang respectively.[31] Later that month, Josh Lawson, Jessica McNamee, Chin Han and Hiroyuki Sanada were cast as Kano, Sonya Blade, Shang Tsung and Scorpion respectively, with Lewis Tan in the role of Cole Young, an original character created for the film.[32][33] On September 16, 2019, it was announced that Max Huang had been cast as Kung Lao.[8] Stuntwoman Elissa Cadwell was announced as having been cast as Nitara on November 11, 2019.[9] However, in the film she is actually played by Mel Jarnson. Matilda Kimber was cast as Emily on December 4, 2019.[34] Filming[edit] Production took place at Adelaide Studios and other locations in South Australia,[35] lasting from September 16 to December 13, 2019.[36] In November 2020, Todd Garner stated that "we have more days to shoot" in a statement regarding the film's release delay.[37] The film was shot on the ARRI ALEXA LF and Mini LF cameras with Panavision Anamorphic lenses.[38] Music[edit] The score for Mortal Kombat was composed by Benjamin Wallfisch.[39] In March 2021, director Simon McQuoid revealed that Wallfisch actually began compositions for the film before he was officially hired on the project and that the film will include a new version of the track "Techno Syndrome" by The Immortals[40] produced by Wallfisch. Release[edit] Theatrical and streaming[edit] Mortal Kombat was theatrically released internationally, beginning on April 8, 2021,[41] and will later be released in the United States on April 23, 2021, in both theaters and on HBO Max.[42] The film was originally going to be released on March 5, 2021 before being moved up to January 15, 2021.[43] In November 2020, producer Todd Garner confirmed that the film would be delayed until theaters are reopened due to the COVID-19 pandemic,[37] before it was finally dated for release on April 16.[44] As part of its plans for all of its 2021 films, Warner Bros. will also stream the film simultaneously on the HBO Max service for a period of one month, after which the film will be removed until the normal home media release schedule period.[45] In late March 2021, the film was delayed one week from April 16 to April 23.[42][46] The film is scheduled for release in Japan on June 18, 2021, despite not having any Mortal Kombat games released officially in the country due to CERO rules of excessive gore.[47] Marketing[edit] On January 15, 2021, which was when the film was initially set to release prior to being delayed due the COVID-19 pandemic, Entertainment Weekly released a first look of the film, which contained several behind the scenes photos.[48] On February 17, 2021, a series of character posters were released for the film, along with the next announcement that the film's first trailer would be released the following day.[49] On February 18, 2021, the first red band trailer for the film was released online. The trailer received critical acclaim from both fans and critics alike, with particular praise for the gory action sequences and the inclusion of the game's iconic fatalities. A scene featuring Scorpion saying his iconic catchphrase "Get over here!" was also seen as a highlight from the trailer.[50][51] It was later revealed that the film's first trailer had become the most-watched red-band trailer in history, surpassing Logan and Deadpool 2.[52] Reception[edit] Box office[edit] As of April 14th, 2021, the film has grossed $10.7 million worldwide, from a reported budget of $50 million. [53] In its opening international weekend, the film made $10.7 million from 17 countries; its largest market was Russia ($6.1 million).[54] Critical response[edit] James Marsh, of the South China Morning Post, gave a positive review, saying "Director Simon McQuoid understands and honours the film's video game origins, including memorable lines of dialogue and signature fight moves throughout".[55] References[edit] ^ "Mortal Kombat (2021)".
