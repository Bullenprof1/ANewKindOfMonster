Ozploitation films are exploitation films – a category of low-budget horror, comedy, sexploitation and action films – made in Australia[1] after the introduction of the R rating in 1971.[2] The year also marked the beginnings of the Australian New Wave movement, and the Ozploitation style peaked within the same time frame (early 1970s to late 1980s). Ozploitation is often considered a smaller wave within the New Wave, covering a wide range of genres from sexploitation, biker films, horror films and even Kung fu.[3][4] The origin of the term "Ozploitation" is credited to the documentary Not Quite Hollywood: The Wild, Untold Story of Ozploitation!.[5] This 2008 feature explores Ozploitation films made during the Australian New Wave. The film includes interviews with numerous figures involved in Ozploitation, as well as fans of the genre, including American director Quentin Tarantino, who coined the phrase "Aussiesploitation", which director Mark Hartley then shortened to "Ozploitation".[6] Contents 1 Background 2 Filmography 2.1 1970s 2.2 1980s 2.3 1990s 2.4 2000s 2.5 2010s 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Background[edit] Australian horror film production trebled from fewer than 20 films in the 1990s to over 60 films between 2000 and 2008.[7] According to one researcher, "global forces and emerging production and distribution models are challenging the 'narrowness' of cultural policy – a narrowness that mandates a particular film culture, circumscribes certain notions of value and limits the variety of films produced domestically. Despite their low-culture status, horror films have been well suited to the Australian film industry's financial limitations, they are a growth strategy for producers, and a training ground for emerging filmmakers".[8] Filmography[edit] 1970s[edit] The Naked Bunyip (1970) Stork (1971) Walkabout (1971) Wake in Fright (1971) Night of Fear (1972) The Adventures of Barry McKenzie (1972) Alvin Purple (1973) Libido (1973) The Cars That Ate Paris (1974) Petersen (1974) Barry McKenzie Holds His Own (1974) Stone (1974) Alvin Rides Again (1974) The Love Epidemic (1975) The True Story of Eskimo Nell (1975) The Man from Hong Kong (1975) Plugg (1975) Scobie Malone (1975) Inn of the Damned (1975) Australia After Dark (1975) The Great Macarthy (1975) Sidecar Racers (1975) Mad Dog Morgan (1976) Eliza Fraser (1976) End Play (1976) Fantasm (1976) Deathcheaters (1976) Don's Party (1976) Oz (1976) Fantasm Comes Again (1977) The FJ Holden (1977) Raw Deal (1977) Journey Among Women (1977) Summer City (1977) The ABC of Love and Sex: Australia Style (1978) The Scalp Merchant (1978) Stunt Rock (1978) Patrick (1978) Money Movers (1978) Long Weekend (1978) Mad Max (1979) The Last of the Knucklemen (1979) Thirst (1979) The Plumber (1979) Snapshot (1979) Felicity (1979) [9] 1980s[edit] The Chain Reaction (1980) Nightmares (1980) Touch and Go (1980) Harlequin (1980) Race for the Yankee Zephyr (1981) Centrespread (1981) Roadgames (1981) Pacific Banana (1981) The Survivor (1981) Mad Max 2 (1981) Lady Stay Dead (1981) Strange Behavior (1981) Alison's Birthday (1981) Hoodwink (1981) The Killing of Angel Street (1982) Running on Empty (1982) Turkey Shoot (1982) Attack Force Z (1982) Brothers (1982) Dead Easy (1982) Freedom (1982) Next of Kin (1982) A Dangerous Summer (1982) Crosstalk (1982) The Return of Captain Invincible (1983) Midnite Spares (1983) BMX Bandits (1983) Innocent Prey (1983) Goodbye Paradise (1983) Hostage (1983) Coming of Age (1984) Leonora (1984) One Night Stand (1984) Razorback (1984) Melvin, Son of Alvin (1984) Fortress (1985) Wills & Burke (1985) Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985) Fair Game (1986) Frenchman's Farm (1986) Sky Pirates (1986) Frog Dreaming (1986) Run Chrissie Run!
