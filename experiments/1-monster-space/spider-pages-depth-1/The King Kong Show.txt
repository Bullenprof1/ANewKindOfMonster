ABC ran the series in the United States between September 10, 1966, and August 31, 1969.[1] It is the first anime series produced in Japan for an American company (not counting Rankin/Bass' previous Animagic stop motion productions, which were also animated in Japan).[2] This series is an animated adaptation of the famous movie monster King Kong with character designs by Jack Davis and Rod Willis. In this series, the giant ape befriends the Bond family, with whom he goes on various adventures, fighting monsters, robots, aliens, mad scientists and other threats.[3] Unlike King Kong's destructive roles in his movies, the cartoon turned him into a protector of humanity.[4] Included is a parody of spy films of the 1960s called Tom of T.H.U.M.B., about a secret agent for T.H.U.M.B. (the Tiny Human Underground Military Bureau) named Tom and his Asian "sidekick" Swinging Jack, who are accidentally reduced by a shrinking laser ray gun to three inches tall.[5] The pair are sent out in a variety of miniature vehicles by their bad-tempered boss Chief Homer J. Chief to foil the fiendish plots of M.A.D. (Maladjusted, Anti-social and Darn mean), an evil organization made up of black-hatted and black-cloaked scientists "bent on destroying the world for their own gains". In Japan, the first two episodes were combined into a 56-minute special, titled King of the World: The King Kong Show (世界の王者　キングコング大会, Sekai no Ōja: Kingu Kongu Taikai), and was broadcast on NET (now TV Asahi) on December 31, 1966. The rest of the series, with the inclusion of Tom of T.H.U.M.B., was broadcast on NET as King Kong & 00​1⁄7 Tom Thumb (キングコング００​１⁄７親指トム, Kingu Kongu 00​1⁄7 Oyayubi Tomu), and aired from April 5 to October 4, 1967, with a total of 25 episodes. This series was successful enough for Rankin/Bass to extend the Kong franchise to another Japanese company, Toho (which had already produced the hit film King Kong vs. Godzilla in 1962). This resulted in two films: Ebirah, Horror of the Deep (originally intended to be a Kong film) and King Kong Escapes, which was based on The King Kong Show. On November 15, 2005, Sony Wonder released the first eight episodes (two King Kong cartoons separated by a Tom of T.H.U.M.B. cartoon) on two DVD releases titled King Kong: The Animated Series Volume 1 and King Kong: The Animated Series Volume 2. The pilot episode was included, in its two parts for American syndication, between the two DVDs.

The Eighth Wonder of the World, Kong was discovered on Mondo Island (sometimes known as Skull Island) by Bobby Bond, whom he saved from being eaten by a Tyrannosaurus rex. He has also saved Bobby and his family from other disasters afterward. Ever since he has become the family's mascot and a hero. Professor Bond - The head/father of the Bond family. Susan Bond - The teenage daughter. She is always somewhat perplexed by Bobby and Kong's friendship. She is the basis for Susan Watson (Linda Miller) in King Kong Escapes. Susan is always the one that knows what Dr. Who is up to and her fear is dreaming about snakes. Bobby Bond - The young son and Kong's closest companion. Saved by Kong from being eaten by a Tyrannosaurus rex, and they have been friends ever since. Captain Englehorn - A friend to the family and Professor Bond's ship captain. Based on the character from the original King Kong film. Dr. Who - The popular recurring villain. A bald, big-headed, and bespectacled mad scientist who wants to capture Kong and use him for his own evil schemes. He has no relation to the character from the British sci-fi TV series. He is the basis for Hideyo Amamoto's character Dr. Who in King Kong Escapes. Mechani-Kong - Kong's robot double, invented by Dr. Who, who operates it via a control room in the robot's head. Neither the Bonds nor Captain Englehorn ever knows (or even figure out) that Dr. Who invented it, however. It appears in two King Kong segments, "MechaniKong" (the second King Kong segment from Episode 10) and "Anchors Away" (the second King Kong segment from Episode 25). Each segment features a different version of the robot. Each are destroyed by Kong, who barely escaping with his life each time. It is also Kong's nemesis in King Kong Escapes.

The Missing Link to Primates in Comics, comics historian Michael Eury writes, "The Rankin/Bass King Kong was an early case of identity theft, where the Kong name was appropriated (fully under license) to describe a new character that, at best, only remotely resembled his namesake. This was Kong done wrong."[6] References[edit] ^ Clements, Jonathan; McCarthy, Helen (2006). The Anime Encyclopedia (2nd expanded ed.). Berkeley, California: Stone Bridge Press. p. 313340.
