Dual awards in each category were established in 1992: Mythopoeic Fantasy Awards for Adult Literature and Children's Literature; Scholarship Awards in Inklings Studies and Myth and Fantasy Studies.[2] In 2010 a Student Paper Award was introduced for the best paper presented at Mythcon by an undergraduate or graduate student;[3] it was renamed the Alexei Kondratiev Award several months after its creation.[4] The 2018 finalists were announced on May 21, and the winners were announced on July 22 at the annual conference.[5] Contents 1 Mythopoeic Fantasy Awards 1.1 Winners and nominees (1971–1991) 1.2 Adult Literature winners and nominees (1992–present) 1.3 Children's Literature winners and nominees (1992–present) 1.4 Multiple-time winners 1.5 Multiple-time finalists 2 Mythopoeic Scholarship Awards 2.1 Inklings Studies 2.2 Myth & Fantasy Studies 3 References 4 External links Mythopoeic Fantasy Awards[edit] In the following tables, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the novel was first published.[6] Each year links to the corresponding "year in literature".
