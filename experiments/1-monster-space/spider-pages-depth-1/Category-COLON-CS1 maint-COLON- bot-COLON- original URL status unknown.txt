This is a tracking category.It is used to build and maintain lists of pages—primarily for the sake of the lists themselves and their use in article and category maintenance. It is not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme. More information: This category is hidden on its member pages—unless the corresponding user preference is set. These categories are used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse" (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list (discriminated by classifications). This template should only be transcluded in the category namespace(s). Administrators: Please do not delete this category even if it is empty! This category may be empty occasionally or even most of the time. This template should only be transcluded in the category namespace(s). If this category has 1000 items or more, it will report as a backlog. (recount) This hidden tracking category lists pages with CS1 citations that use the bot-specific parameter value |url-status=bot: unknown. The keyword bot: unknown is intended for use by bots to identify original URLs that are live but not confirmed to link to appropriate material. Editors should review these URLs and adjust the value assigned to |url-status= accordingly. Only Module:Citation/CS1 should directly add pages to this category. Other values[edit] |url-status=usurped and |url-status=usurped are tracked at Category:CS1 maint: unfit URL. |url-status=dead is not tracked. |url-status=live is not tracked. |url-status=anythingelse is tracked (with many others) at Category:CS1 errors: invalid parameter value. By default, Citation Style 1 and Citation Style 2 error messages are visible to all readers and maintenance category messages are hidden from all readers. To display maintenance messages, include the following text in your common CSS page or your specific skin's CSS page (common.css and skin.css respectively): .mw-parser-output span.cs1-maint {display: inline;} /* display Citation Style 1 maintenance messages */
 To display hidden-by-default error messages: .mw-parser-output span.cs1-hidden-error {display: inline;} /* display hidden Citation Style 1 error messages */
 Even with this CSS installed, older pages in Wikipedia's cache may not have been updated to show these error messages even though the page is listed in one of the tracking categories. A null edit will resolve that issue. To hide normally-displayed error messages: .mw-parser-output span.cs1-visible-error {display: none;} /* hide Citation Style 1 error messages */
 You can personalize the display of these messages (such as changing the color), but you will need to ask someone who knows CSS or at the technical village pump if you do not understand how.
