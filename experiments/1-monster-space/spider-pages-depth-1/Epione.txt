For the moth genus, see Epione (moth). Look up Epione in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. In Greek mythology, Epione (Greek: Ἠπιόνη) is the wife of Asclepius.[1] Her name derives from the word ηπιος (epios, "soothing"), and she was probably a personification of the care needed for recovery.[1] With Asclepius, she had two sons, Machaon and Podalirius, who are mentioned in the Iliad of Homer.[2] The Suda lists Aceso, Aglaea, Hygieia, Iaso, and Panacaea as her daughters.[3] Epigraphical evidence suggests that Epione was a cultic figure in Athens, Epidauros, Kos, and Pergamon.[1] See also[edit] List of Greek mythological figures Telesphoros References[edit] ^ a b c Mylonopoulos, Ioannis.
