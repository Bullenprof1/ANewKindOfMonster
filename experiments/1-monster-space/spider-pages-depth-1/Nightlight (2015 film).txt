While playing the game nightlight, the teens start hearing strange noises and try to leave, but are stopped through unseen forces. Robin later learns through Nia's video camera and confession from Nia herself that the four of them invited her out to scare her during the game. The teens are repeatedly separated and lost. Robin concludes that the soul of her deceased friend Ethan wants revenge for lying to him and believes she is the reason he killed himself. One by one, Robin and the other teens are then picked off until Robin is the only left standing. She tries to reason with Ethan, as well beg for his forgiveness. Robin is then locked inside the church and possessed. She kills Nia before walking to a cliff and jumping. As the camera pans out from Robin's body the other teens are seen as well. Ethan's flashlight can also finally be seen. There is a short scene with Ethan's suicide note though no real reason is given.
