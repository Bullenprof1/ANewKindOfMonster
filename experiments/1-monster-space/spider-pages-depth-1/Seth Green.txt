He has one sister, Kaela. Green later legally changed his name to Seth Benjamin Green "to reflect my professional stage name."[3][4] Green was raised Jewish and had a Bar Mitzvah ceremony.[5] His ancestors were from Russia, Poland, and Scotland.[6] Green started acting at the age of 7.[7] His early comic influences included Monty Python, Blackadder, Saturday Night Live, Richard Pryor, Bill Cosby, Porky's, and Caddyshack.[8][9] Career[edit] Early work[edit] Green's first movie roles were in the 1984 films Billions for Boris and The Hotel New Hampshire; the second film cast him alongside Jodie Foster and Rob Lowe. He appeared in the 1987 film Can't Buy Me Love, playing Patrick Dempsey's character's little brother, Chuckie Miller. He starred in Woody Allen's Radio Days (1987) as Joe (a 1930s–1940s boy based on Allen) and appeared in Big Business (1988) and, in the same year, My Stepmother Is an Alien, which also starred Buffy the Vampire Slayer co-star Alyson Hannigan. In 1984, Green portrayed Carl "Alfalfa" Switzer in the Jell-O Gelatin Pops commercials featuring The Little Rascals. In 1991, Green rose to fame in a Rally's "Cha Ching" commercial,[10][11] which earned him an appearance at a New Orleans Saints game. Green was given a key to New Orleans in honor of his role in the popular commercial.[12] Green appeared in the horror TV series It (as Richie Tozier, age 12) and Ticks, all three Austin Powers movies (as Dr. Evil's son, Scott), and Enemy of the State and The Italian Job (as a computer specialist in both). He was also in the films Can't Hardly Wait, Rat Race, Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, Without a Paddle (alongside Matthew Lillard), Idle Hands, Party Monster, Airborne, and Old Dogs. Green also had a role in the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In 1994, he starred alongside Jennifer Love Hewitt in the short-lived series The Byrds of Paradise. He worked with Hewitt again in 1998's Can't Hardly Wait. Green is not related to Bruce Seth Green, who directed some episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. On occasion, some sources confuse the two and have credited Seth as the director. As an actor in the series, he was close to co-star Alyson Hannigan because they were lovers in the show. He played Daniel "Oz" Osbourne, a calm, mild-mannered band member who gets turned into a werewolf. He is very popular among fans of the series. Green has starred on Fox's Greg the Bunny and guest-starred on The X-Files, That '70s Show, Will & Grace, MADtv, Reno 911!, Entourage, Grey's Anatomy, The Wonder Years, Heroes, The Facts of Life, The Drew Carey Show, and My Name Is Earl. Family Guy[edit] Green at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con for Family Guy Green provides the voice of Chris for the animated television sitcom Family Guy, created by Seth MacFarlane for Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the dysfunctional Griffin family and also stars MacFarlane, Alex Borstein, Mila Kunis, and Mike Henry. Green primarily voices Chris Griffin, the teenage son, who is overweight, unintelligent and, in many respects, a younger version of his father, and Neil Goldman, a neighbor of the Griffins.[13] Green did an impression of the Buffalo Bill character from the thriller film The Silence of the Lambs during his audition.[14] Green has stated that his main inspiration for Chris' voice came from envisioning how "Buffalo Bill" would sound if he were speaking through a PA system at a McDonald's.[15] Later work[edit] Green is a co-creator, co-producer, writer, director, and most frequent voice of the Emmy-winning stop-motion sketch comedy TV series Robot Chicken, for which he does many voices and has appeared in animated form. Green is friends with the band Fall Out Boy, making a cameo in their music video, "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race". He also appeared in "Weird Al" Yankovic's "White & Nerdy" music video. He made two appearances on The Soup in 2007 and 2008, using his first appearance to lampoon Internet celebrity Chris Crocker.[16] He voiced the character Jeff "Joker" Moreau, pilot of the SSV Normandy and later the Normandy SR2, in the video games Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2, and Mass Effect 3.[17][18] He is a producer of The 1 Second Film and appears in the "making of" documentary that accompanies its feature-length credits. Green is also the co-creator (with Hugh Sterbakov) of the comic Freshmen, published by Top Cow Productions. Green, along with Robot Chicken co-producer Breckin Meyer, appeared in the NBC show Heroes during the 2008–09 season.[19] In January 2009, Green worked with David Faustino (Bud Bundy from Married... with Children) for an episode of Faustino's show Star-ving – Faustino is often mistaken for Green.[20] Later in the same year, he worked with one of his idols, Robin Williams in comedy film Old Dogs, which also starred John Travolta. On July 13, World Wrestling Entertainment's official website announced Green as the special guest host for the July 13 episode of WWE Raw, and on that night, Green competed in the main event, a six-man tag team match, which his team won by disqualification.[21][22] He was also in attendance for WWE's biggest event of the year, WrestleMania XXVI on March 28, 2010. Green guest-starred in the third season of the acclaimed sitcom Husbands.[23] Green became the new voice of Leonardo in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles beginning in its third season (following Jason Biggs' departure from the role).[24] In 2019, he wrote and released his first movie named Changeland, starring Brenda Song and Macaulay Culkin. The movie was released on June 7, 2019.[1] Personal life[edit] After getting engaged on New Year's Eve in 2009, Green married actress Clare Grant on May 1, 2010, in Northern California.[25] The two currently[when?] live in Los Angeles.[4][better source needed] They worked together on Robot Chicken, Warren the Ape, Changeland, Holidays, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.,and her Saber and "Geek and Gamer Girls Song" viral videos.[26][27] In 2000, Green stated, "God is, to me, pretty much an idea. God is, to me, pretty much a myth created over time to deny the idea that we're all responsible for our own actions."[28] He later clarified in 2013: I believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I find it sad and unfortunate how many wars are fought and lives are lost in a quest to insist that someone else pray the same way you do. I have a deep belief in the divinity of the Universe, and I had no ability to really comprehend the scope or magnitude of all the things that I don't understand. But I've never been the guy who says 'I don't believe in God' or 'I don't believe in some kind of overlaying, governing force that makes everything symmetrical' and I've never been interested in being anyone's spokesman, whether it's organized religion or the opposite. I'm my own spokesperson. I take great pains to always say I only speak for me.[29] Filmography[edit] Film[edit] Year Title Role Notes 1984 Billions for Boris Benjamin "Ape-Face" Andrews 1984 The Hotel New Hampshire "Egg" Berry 1986 Willy/Milly Malcolm 1987 Radio Days Joe 1987 Can't Buy Me Love Chuckie Miller 1988 Big Business Jason 1988 My Stepmother Is an Alien Fred Glass 1990 Missing Parents Leo 1990 Pump Up the Volume Joey 1991 Our Shining Moment Wheels 1992 The Double 0 Kid Chip 1992 Buffy the Vampire Slayer Vampire 1993 Ticks Tyler Burns 1993 Arcade Stilts 1993 Airborne Wiley 1993 The Day My Parents Ran Away Leo 1995 Notes from Underground Punk Neighbor 1995 White Man's Burden 3rd Youth at Hot Dog Stand 1996 To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday Danny Green 1997 Boys Life 2 Homophobe #2 Segment: "Nunzio's Second Cousin" 1997 Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery Scott Evil 1998 Can't Hardly Wait Kenny Fisher 1998 Enemy of the State Selby Uncredited[30] 1999 Idle Hands Mick 1999 Stonebrook Cornelius 1999 Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me Scott Evil 2001 Rock Star 101 Le'Von Short film 2001 The Trumpet of the Swan Boyd (voice) 2001 The Attic Expeditions Douglas 2001 Josie and the Pussycats Travis 2001 America's Sweethearts Danny Wax 2001 Rat Race Duane Cody 2001 Knockaround Guys Johnny Marbles 2002 Austin Powers in Goldmember Scott Evil 2003 Party Monster James St. James 2003 The Italian Job Lyle / "Napster" 2004 Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed Patrick Wisely 2004 Without a Paddle Dan Mott 2005 Be Cool Shotgun Uncredited 2005 Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story Chris Griffin, Various (voices) Direct-to-video 2005 The Best Man Murray 2006 Electric Apricot: Quest for Festeroo Jonah "the Taper Guy" 2006 The TV Set Slut Wars Host 2008 Sex Drive Ezekiel 2009 Old Dogs Craig White 2010 Iron Man 2 Expo Fan Cameo[31] 2011 Mars Needs Moms Milo Motion capture only 2011 The Story of Luke Zack 2013 Sexy Evil Genius Zachary Newman 2013 Dear Mr. Watterson Himself Documentary 2013 I Know That Voice Himself Documentary 2014 Guardians of the Galaxy Howard the Duck (voice) Uncredited cameo[32] 2014 The Identical Dino 2014 Yellowbird Yellowbird (voice) 2015 Wrestling Isn't Wrestling DX Fan Short film 2015 Krampus Lumpy (voice) 2016 Holidays Pete Gunderson 2017 The Lego Batman Movie King Kong (voice) [33] 2017 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Howard the Duck (voice) 2018 A Futile and Stupid Gesture Christopher Guest 2018 Dear Dictator Dr. Charles Seaver 2019 Godzilla: King of the Monsters Fighter Pilot Uncredited 2019 Changeland[1] Brandon Also writer and director 2020 Wednesdays[34] Patrick Post-production Television[edit] Year Title Role Notes 1984 Young People's Specials Charlie Episode: "Charlie's Christmas Secret" 1985 ABC Afterschool Special Tommy Sanders Episode: "I Want to Go Home" 1985 Tales from the Darkside Timmy Episode: "Monsters in My Room" 1986 Amazing Stories Lance Episode: "The Sitter" 1986 Spenser: For Hire Andy Chandler Episode: "The Hopes and Fears" 1988 The Facts of Life Adam Brinkerhoff 2 episodes 1989 Free Spirit Joey Episode: "Too Much of a Good Thing" 1989 Mr. Belvedere Louis 2 episodes: "Big", "Paper Mill" 1990 Life Goes On William Butler 2 episodes 1990 It Young Richie Tozier 2 episodes 1991 Good & Evil David 6 episodes 1992 Evening Shade Larry Phipps Episode: "Hasta la Vista" 1992 The Wonder Years Jimmy Donnelly 2 episodes 1992 Batman: The Animated Series Wizard (voice) Episode: "I Am the Night" 1993 Beverly Hills, 90210 Wayne Episode: "The Game Is Chicken" 1993 The X-Files Emil Episode: "Deep Throat" 1993 seaQuest DSV Nick "Wolfman" Episode: "Photon Bullet" 1994 The Byrds of Paradise Harry Byrd 8 episodes 1994 Weird Science Lubec Episode: "Lisa's Virus" 1995 Haunted Lives: True Ghost Stories Termite Miniseries 1995 Step by Step Danny Episode: "Head of the Class" 1996 Something So Right Napoleon Episode: "Pilot" 1997 Pearl Bob Episode: "Mission ImPearlsible" 1997 Mad About You Bobby Rubenfeld Episode: "Guardianhood" 1997 The Drew Carey Show The MC Episode: "That Thing You Don't" 1997 Temporarily Yours David Silver 6 episodes 1997–2000 Buffy the Vampire Slayer Daniel "Oz" Osbourne 39 episodes 1998 Cybill Jaybo Episode: "Cybill Sheridan's Day Off" 1999–present Family Guy Chris Griffin, Various voices Main role 1999 Angel Daniel "Oz" Osbourne Episode: "In the Dark" 1999 Saturday Night Live Himself Episode: "Sarah Michelle Gellar/Backstreet Boys" 1999–2000 Batman Beyond Nelson Nash, Dempsey (voices) 8 episodes 1999–2000 100 Deeds for Eddie McDowd Eddie McDowd (voice) 13 episodes 2000–2005 MADtv Brightling 4 episodes 2000 Tucker Himself 3 episodes 2002 Greg the Bunny Jimmy Bender 13 episodes 2002 Whatever Happened to Robot Jones?
