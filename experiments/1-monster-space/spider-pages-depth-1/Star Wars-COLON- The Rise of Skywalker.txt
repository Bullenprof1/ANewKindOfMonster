Abrams. Produced by Lucasfilm and Abrams' production company Bad Robot Productions, and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the third installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy, following The Force Awakens (2015) and The Last Jedi (2017), and the final episode of the nine-part "Skywalker saga".[a] The film's ensemble cast includes Carrie Fisher,[b] Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Anthony Daniels, Naomi Ackie, Domhnall Gleeson, Richard E. Grant, Lupita Nyong'o, Keri Russell, Joonas Suotamo, Kelly Marie Tran, Ian McDiarmid, and Billy Dee Williams. The Rise of Skywalker follows Rey, Finn, and Poe Dameron as they lead the Resistance's final stand against Supreme Leader Kylo Ren and the First Order, who are aided by the return of the deceased Galactic Emperor, Palpatine. Following initial reports that The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson would write the script for Episode IX, in August 2015, Colin Trevorrow was hired to direct and to write a script with his collaborator Derek Connolly; both ultimately retain story credit with Abrams and Chris Terrio. In September 2017, Trevorrow left the project following creative differences with producer Kathleen Kennedy, and Abrams returned as director. John Williams, composer for the previous episodic films, returned to compose the score for the last time for the franchise. Principal photography began in August 2018 at Pinewood Studios in England and wrapped in February 2019, with post-production completed in November 2019. With an estimated budget of $275 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made. The film premiered in Los Angeles on December 16, 2019, and was released in the United States on December 20. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the acting, action sequences, musical score, and visual effects, but criticized the story, pacing, and its perceived departures from the plot and themes of The Last Jedi. The film grossed over $1.074 billion worldwide, becoming the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2019; although the film was the lowest-grossing installment of the trilogy, it turned an estimated net profit of $300 million. The film received three nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards (Best Original Score, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound Editing) as well as three at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards (also Best Special Visual Effects, Best Original Music, and Best Sound).

There, he finds Palpatine, who reveals that he created Snoke as a puppet to control the First Order and lure Kylo to the dark side. Palpatine unveils the Final Order—a secret armada of Star Destroyers—and tells Kylo to find and kill Rey, who is continuing her Jedi training under Resistance leader Leia Organa. Finn and Poe Dameron deliver intelligence from a spy that Palpatine is on Exegol; Rey has learned from Luke Skywalker's notes that a Sith Wayfinder can lead them there. Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca, BB-8, and C-3PO depart in the Millennium Falcon to Pasaana, where a clue to a Wayfinder is hidden. Kylo initiates a Force bond with Rey to discover her location; he travels to Pasaana with his warrior subordinates, the Knights of Ren. With the help of Lando Calrissian, Rey and her friends find the clue—a dagger inscribed with Sith text, which C-3PO's programming forbids him from interpreting—and the remains of a Jedi hunter named Ochi and his ship. Rey senses Kylo nearby and faces him. The First Order captures the Falcon, Chewbacca, and the dagger; attempting to save Chewbacca, Rey accidentally destroys a First Order transport with Force lightning. Believing Chewbacca to be dead, the group escapes on Ochi's ship. The group travels to Kijimi, where a droidsmith extracts the Sith text from C-3PO's memory, revealing coordinates to a Wayfinder. Rey senses Chewbacca is alive, and the group mounts a rescue mission to Kylo's Star Destroyer. Rey recovers the dagger and has visions of Ochi killing her parents with it. Kylo informs her that she is Palpatine's granddaughter; the Sith Lord had ordered Ochi to recover Rey as a child, but her parents hid her on Jakku to protect her. General Hux saves Poe, Finn, and Chewbacca from execution, revealing himself as the spy. He permits the group to escape on the Falcon but is discovered and killed by Allegiant General Pryde. The group flies the Falcon to the Wayfinder's coordinates on a moon in the Endor system. Rey retrieves the Wayfinder from the remains of the second Death Star, but she is met by Kylo, who destroys the Wayfinder and duels her. In a dying act, Leia calls to Kylo through the Force, distracting him as Rey impales him. Sensing Leia's death, Rey heals Kylo and takes his ship to exile herself on Ahch-To. There, Luke's Force spirit encourages Rey to face Palpatine and gives her Leia's lightsaber. Rey leaves for Exegol in Luke's X-wing fighter, using the Wayfinder from Kylo's ship. Meanwhile, Kylo converses with a memory of his father, Han Solo; he throws away his lightsaber and reclaims his identity as Ben Solo. Sensing Leia's death and Ben's redemption, Palpatine sends one of his superlaser-equipped Star Destroyers to destroy Kijimi as a show of force. Rey transmits her coordinates to R2-D2, allowing the Resistance—now led by Poe and Finn—to follow her to Exegol. There, she confronts Palpatine; he demands that she kill him for his spirit to pass into her. Lando brings reinforcements from across the galaxy to join the battle. Ben overpowers the Knights of Ren and joins Rey, but Palpatine drains their power to rejuvenate himself. He incapacitates Ben and attacks the Resistance fleet with Force lightning. Weakened, Rey hears the voices of past Jedi, who lend her their strength. Palpatine attacks her with lightning, but Rey deflects it using Luke and Leia's lightsabers,[c] killing Palpatine before dying herself. Ben uses the Force to revive her at the cost of his own life; Rey kisses Ben before he dies. The Resistance defeats Palpatine's armada, while people across the galaxy rise up against the First Order. The Resistance returns to their base to celebrate. After the celebration, Rey visits Luke's abandoned childhood home on Tatooine and buries his and Leia's lightsabers. A passerby asks her name; as the spirits of Luke and Leia watch, she replies, "Rey Skywalker."

J. Abrams returned to direct the final film. In February 2016, Disney chief executive officer Bob Iger confirmed that pre-production on Episode IX had begun.[41] Carrie Fisher died in December 2016.[42] Prior to the release of the film, Carrie Fisher's brother Todd Fisher, who planned her character General Leia Organa to appear in the film before her death, revealed that “she was going to be the big payoff in the final film” and “she was going to be the last Jedi, so to speak.”[43] In August 2017, it was announced that Jack Thorne would rewrite the script.[44] In September 2017, Lucasfilm stated that Trevorrow had left the production following creative differences,[45] resulting his working relationship with Kathleen Kennedy to become unmanageable after failing to deliver a satisfactory script, despite writing several drafts.[46] That same month, Johnson was rumored as the top choice to replace Trevorrow as director,[47] but stated "it was never in the plan for me to direct Episode IX",[48] and later, J. J. Abrams, the director of The Force Awakens, was announced to return as the director in Episode IX.[49] The story team met with George Lucas before writing the new script to discuss the nature of the Force.[50] Abrams co-wrote the script with Chris Terrio,[51] though Trevorrow and Connolly retain story credits.[52][53][g] The story was rewritten to some extent before filming was completed.[56] The film was produced by Abrams' company Bad Robot Productions, Kathleen Kennedy, and Michelle Rejwan.[51] According to Terrio, the film's script had to include certain narrative beats provided by Kennedy and Rejwan, including the redemption of the character Kylo Ren.[57] Before filming, Episode IX was initially given the working title Black Diamond, which was then changed to TrIXie in 2018,[58] so that the roman numeral "IX" would be included in the working title.[59] The film's title, The Rise of Skywalker, was announced at April 2019's the Star Wars Celebration in Chicago.[60] Casting[edit] Carrie Fisher, who played Leia Organa, died on December 27, 2016.[42] Variety and Reuters reported that she had been planned for a key role in Episode IX.[61] In January 2017, Lucasfilm stated that there were no plans to digitally generate Fisher's performance as they had for Rogue One (2016).[62] The following April, Fisher's brother Todd revealed that Fisher's daughter, Billie Lourd, had granted Disney the rights to use recent footage of Fisher.[63] However, a week later, Kathleen Kennedy stated that Fisher would not appear in the film.[64][65] In July 2018, J. J. Abrams announced that unused footage of Fisher from The Force Awakens would be used to help complete the story.[11][12][66] In flashback scenes, digital de-aging was used for the appearance of Luke and Leia through the use of facial shots of both characters from the Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi respectively.[67] Billy Dee Williams (left) and Ian McDiarmid (right) returned as Lando Calrissian and Emperor Palpatine, onscreen for the first time since Return of the Jedi (1983) and Revenge of the Sith (2005), respectively.[22][68] In July 2018, Keri Russell was in talks to play a part with some "action-heavy fight scenes",[69] and it was confirmed that Billy Dee Williams would return as Lando Calrissian,[70] onscreen for the first time since 1983's Return of the Jedi—marking one of the longest intervals between portrayals of a character by the same actor in American film history.[68][h] At the end of July, Russell was confirmed to have been cast,[71] and there was an announcement of returning and additional new cast members.[6] In late August, Deadline Hollywood announced that Dominic Monaghan and Matt Smith had been cast in unspecified roles,[72][73] but Smith later denied his involvement.[74][i] Greg Grunberg reprises his role as Temmin "Snap" Wexley.[27] At the Star Wars Celebration in April 2019, it was revealed via the film's teaser trailer that Ian McDiarmid would return to portray Palpatine.[22] Since the event was held after principal photography wrapped, Abrams was thrilled that news of McDiarmid on the set never leaked.[22] Kathleen Kennedy said they decided to reveal Palpatine's return ahead of the film's release because of the characters playing a larger role in the story, having them differentiated from Baby Yoda, the character from The Mandalorian.[77] Filming[edit] Wadi Rum in Jordan served as the location for the desert planet Pasaana. Principal photography began on August 1, 2018, at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England.[6] Filming also took place in Wadi Rum, Jordan.[78] Oscar Isaac stated that Abrams was allowing more improvised acting than in the previous two films.[79] Due to the tight schedule, some editing took place on set.[80] Principal photography wrapped on February 15, 2019.[81] Footage from the film was shown at The Walt Disney Company's annual shareholders meeting on March 7, 2019.[82] Two weeks of reshoots took place at Pinewood involving Hamill, Ridley, and Isaac in July 2019.[83] Another round of reshoots took place at Bad Robot Productions between late September and mid-October.[84] Post-production[edit] The visual effects were created by Industrial Light & Magic and supervised by Roger Guyett.[85] The film finished post-production on November 25, 2019.[86] After Boyega accidentally left a copy of the script in his hotel room, it was listed on eBay for around £65.[87] Music[edit] Main article: Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (soundtrack) In January 2018, it was confirmed that John Williams would return to compose and conduct The Rise of Skywalker.[88][89] The next month, Williams announced that it would be the last Star Wars film for which he would compose the score.[90] In August 2019, it was revealed that Williams had written about 35 of an expected 135 minutes of music for the film, which according to Williams' brother Don, would incorporate all of the major themes of the Skywalker saga.[91] Scoring began in July 2019 with Williams and William Ross conducting and orchestrating the sessions over the course of six months.[92] The official soundtrack album was released by Walt Disney Records on December 20, 2019.[93] Marketing[edit] Promotion[edit] Despite staying silent about many details of the film, Abrams expressed his hopes that fans and general audiences would be "satisfied".[94] He headed a panel dedicated to the film on April 12, 2019, during the Star Wars Celebration in Chicago,[95] where the film's title was revealed.[60] Additionally, the story events of the Disneyland themed area Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge precede the film, including the Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run motion simulator, which features Chewbacca.[96] On August 24, a new poster and "sizzle reel" was released at D23;[21] the latter was released to the public two days later. The footage includes a montage of the Skywalker saga so far, as well as several new shots from the film.[97] Tie-in literature and merchandise[edit] A publishing campaign titled "Journey to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker" was announced on May 4, 2019. It includes the novel Resistance Reborn, set between The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker, and various other titles.[98] From December 18, 2019, to March 11, 2020, a prequel graphic novel titled The Rise of Kylo Ren, telling the story of how Ben Solo became Kylo Ren and elaborating upon the character's backstory, was published by Marvel Comics, written by Charles Soule and illustrated by Will Sliney.[99] The official novelization of The Rise of Skywalker is by Rae Carson: hardcover and audiobook versions were released on March 19, 2020. The novel details Palpatine's return in more depth: he transferred his consciousness into a clone body following his death in Return of the Jedi, and his "son", Rey's father, was a failed clone of Palpatine.[100][101] The junior novel and corresponding audiobook are by Michael Kogge and were released on April 21, 2020. Additionally, a five-issue Marvel Comics adaptation written by Jody Houser and illustrated by Will Sliney was originally planned to debut in mid-2020,[102][103] but this was later canceled, making the film the first in the franchise not to receive a comic adaptation.[104] Video games[edit] The video game Star Wars Battlefront II (2017) released a free level set on Ajan Kloss.[105] In December 2019, the video game Fortnite Battle Royale released several cosmetics featuring character skins for Rey, Finn, a Sith Trooper, Kylo Ren, and Zorii Bliss along with a TIE fighter glider, a Millennium Falcon glider (which was given to players for free from the Winterfest Event), four emotes, and two free banners.[106] On December 14, Fortnite's publisher Epic Games released a preview of the film on an in-game theater screen as a live event.[107] At the end of the event, a message from Palpatine (the one mentioned in the film's opening crawl) was heard.[108] Release[edit] Theatrical[edit] The film was originally planned to be released in the United States on May 24, 2019, before being pushed back to December 20.[109] It had its world premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on December 16.[110] Unlike most studio films, Disney reportedly did not hold test screenings for The Rise of Skywalker, instead only showing it to Abrams' friends and family, as well as a terminally-ill fan.[111][112] Before the film's release, Disney issued a warning that the scenes with strobe-like flashing lights may trigger photosensitive migraines and seizures during some of those scenes.[113] Home media[edit] The Rise of Skywalker was scheduled to be released on Digital HD on March 17, 2020, but was released four days early in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic.[114] Its DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K Ultra HD release was followed on March 31 by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment.[115] The 4K version of the film was also released in "The Skywalker Saga" Ultra HD Blu-ray box set that same date.[116] It was released on Disney+ on May 4, which is reportedly two months ahead of its previously scheduled release date.[117] Reception[edit] Box office[edit] Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker grossed $515.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $558.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.074 billion.[4] Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $300 million when factoring together all expenses and revenues.[3] Pre-sale tickets went on sale on October 21, 2019, and the film sold more tickets in their first hour of availability on Atom Tickets than the previous record-holder for ticket sales, Avengers: Endgame (2019). It became Atom Tickets' second-best first-day seller of all time behind Endgame, selling more than twice the number of tickets as The Last Jedi sold in that same timeframe, while Fandango reported it outsold all previous Star Wars films.[118][119] Box office tracking had The Rise of Skywalker grossing around $200 million in its opening weekend, though some firms predicted a debut closer to $175 million.[120] The film made $90 million on its first day, including $40 million from Thursday night previews.[121][122] It went on to debut to $177.3 million, and it was also noted that Saturday (which saw a 47% drop from Friday's gross) was the busiest shopping day of the year, likely affecting ticket sales.[123] The film made $32 million on Christmas Day, the second-best total ever for the holiday after The Force Awakens' $49.3 million in 2015.[124] It went on to have a five-day total of $138.8 million, including $76 million for the weekend.[125] In its third weekend, the film made $34.5 million, remaining in first,[126][127] before being dethroned in its fourth weekend by newcomer 1917 (2019).[128] Worldwide the film was projected to gross around $450 million in its opening weekend, including $250 million from 52 international territories.[129] It made $59.1 million from its first day of international release in 46 countries. The biggest markets were the United Kingdom ($8.3 million), Germany ($7.2 million), France ($5.3 million), and Australia ($4.3 million).[130] In China, the film made $1.6 million (RMB11.6 million) through its first day.[131] It went on to open to $198 million from overseas countries and $373.5 million worldwide, coming in below projections and 47% lower than The Last Jedi's total. Its biggest opening totals remained the UK ($26.8 million), Germany ($21.8 million), France ($15.2 million), Japan ($14.6 million), Australia ($12.6 million), and China ($12.1 million).[130] Critical response[edit] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 51% of 507 reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "The Rise of Skywalker suffers from a frustrating lack of imagination, but concludes this beloved saga with fan-focused devotion."[132] As of January 2020, the film is the lowest-rated live-action film of the Star Wars series.[133] According to the review aggregator Metacritic, which sampled 61 reviews and calculated a weighted average of 53 out of 100, The Rise of Skywalker received "mixed or average reviews".[134] Richard Roeper, reviewing for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film three stars out of four, writing that it "rarely comes close to touching greatness, but it's a solid, visually dazzling and warmhearted victory [for] quality filmmaking."[135] The A.V. Club's A. A. Dowd gave the film a C+, stating that the film "is so freighted with obligation that it almost groans under the weight, flashing a weak smile as it vaguely approximates the appearance of a zippy good time."[136] Michael Phillips for Chicago Tribune wrote that the film "does the job. It wraps up the trio of trilogies begun in 1977 in a confident, soothingly predictable way, doing all that is cinematically possible to avoid [upsetting the] tradition-minded quadrants of the Star Wars fan base."[137] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle described the film as "a disappointment" and wrote, "For all the movie's faults, it's likely that most people will consider The Rise of Skywalker and accept the trade: Sit through a so-so 110 minutes to get to a strong half hour."[138] Owen Gleiberman of Variety called the film "the most elegant, emotionally rounded, and gratifying Star Wars adventure since the glory days of Star Wars (1977) and The Empire Strikes Back (1980) [...] but given the last eight films, the bar isn't that high."[139] The BBC's Nicholas Barber praised the film's acting and wrote, "The Rise of Skywalker has been lovingly crafted by a host of talented people, and yet the best they can do is pay tribute to everything he did several decades ago."[140] Scott Mendelson for Forbes described the film as "possibly worse" compared to the previous Skywalker saga films while ending the main saga and "denying this new trilogy its artistic reason for existence", and criticized the film for retconning The Last Jedi and its plot; saying that "patronizing reversals in the name of mollifying the fans who merely want to be reminded of the first three movies."[141] Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times described the film as "a Last Jedi corrective", which is "more accurate way to describe it" and is "an epic failure of nerve"; saying that "feels more like a retreat, a return to a zone of emotional and thematic safety from a filmmaker with a gift for packaging nostalgia as subversion."[142] Writing for The New Yorker, Richard Brody states that the film's faults "are those of the franchise over all"; as the film's director "J. J. Abrams is mainly a distiller and a magnifier and brings virtually no originality to it", using the controls of Michael Bay.[143] Whereas Asian actress Kelly Marie Tran was a main character in The Last Jedi, she appears for about a minute in The Rise of Skywalker. The reduced role was interpreted by some critics as a concession to fans who disliked her character;[144] Tran had been a target of online harassment following the release of The Last Jedi. People involved on the previous film defended her, with some claiming some of the attackers were racist, and body shamers.[145] Critics said she was "sidelined" into a minor character, and commented on how she was written out "without any explanation" and her minor role was considered by one critic to be "one of the film's biggest disappointments".[146][147] In regards to the criticism towards her reduced screen-time, screenwriter Chris Terrio said it was due to the difficulty of including the deceased Carrie Fisher archive footage in scenes planned to feature both characters.[148] Audience response[edit] According to CinemaScore, American audiences gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, the lowest among the live-action films.[123][149] On PostTrak, audiences gave the film an average four stars out of five, with 70% saying they would definitely recommend it; parents and children under 12 years old (who made up 16% of opening night attendance) gave it a full five stars out of five. Men (who made up 67% of the audience) gave the film an overall positive score of 80% while women (32%) gave it an 84%.[123][150] RelishMix, which tracks social media posts and online presence, "noticed a divided reaction to Skywalker online, though it leaned slightly positive".[123] Months prior to the film's trailer release, it was review bombed on Rotten Tomatoes to the point where the "Want to See" percentage went down as far as 5% within a day, with many of the reviews focusing on lingering negativity towards The Last Jedi.[151] Similar bombing with Captain Marvel (2019) caused Rotten Tomatoes to completely remove the "Want to See" feature after temporarily changing it to a number.[151] Accolades[edit] Award Date of ceremony Category Recipient(s) Result Ref.
