In Greek mythology, Perse (Ancient Greek: Πέρση) also spelled as Persa or Perseis, was an Oceanid nymph, one of the three thousand daughters of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys.[1] Contents 1 Mythology 2 Possible connections 3 Footnote 4 Notes 5 References Mythology[edit] Perse was one of the wives of the sun god, Helios.[2][3] According to Homer and Hesiod, with Helios she had Circe and Aeetes,[4][5] with later authors also mentioning her children Pasiphae,[6][7][8] Perses[9] and Aloeus.[10] When Aphrodite cursed Helios to fall in love with the mortal princess Leucothoe, he is said to have forgotten even about Perse.[11] She seems to have been linked to witchcraft and knowledge of herbs and potions, much like her daughters Circe and Pasiphae.[12] She might have also been associated with the witchcraft goddess Hecate, who was also called Perseis (as in "daughter of Perses")[13] and who is said to be Circe's mother in one version.[14] Possible connections[edit] Perseis' name has been linked to Περσίς (Persís), "female Persian", and πέρθω (pérthō), "destroy" or "slay" or "plunder". An inscription of Mycenaean Greek (written in Linear B) was found on a tablet from Pylos, dating back to 1400–1200 BC. John Chadwick reconstructed[n 1] the name of a goddess, *Preswa who could be identified with Perse. Chadwick found speculative the further identification with the first element of Persephone.[16][17] Footnote[edit] ^ The actual word in Linear B is 𐀟𐀩𐁚, pe-re-*82 or pe-re-swa; it is found on the PY Tn 316 tablet.[15] Notes[edit] ^ Hesiod, Theogony 356 ^ Hecataeus of Miletus, fr. 35A Fowler ^ Hard, p. 44 ^ Homer, Odyssey 10.135 ^ Hesiod, Theogony 956 ^ Apollonius of Rhodes, Argonautica 4.591 ^ Apollodorus, Library 1.9.1 ^ Cicero, De Natura Deorum 48.4 ^ Hyginus, Fabulae Preface ^ John Tzetzes ad Lycophron vs. 174 ^ Ovid, Metamorphoses 4.205 ^ Ovid, The Cure for Love Part IV ^ Apollonius of Rhodes, Argonautica 3.478 ^ Diodorus Siculus, Historic Library 4.45.1 ^ Raymoure, K.A.
