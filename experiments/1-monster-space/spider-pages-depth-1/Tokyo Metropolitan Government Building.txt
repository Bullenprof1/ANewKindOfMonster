Located in Shinjuku, the building was designed by architect Kenzo Tange. It consists of a complex of three structures, each taking up a city block. The tallest of the three is Tokyo Metropolitan Main building No.1, a tower 48 stories tall that splits into two sections at the 33rd floor. The building also has three levels below ground. The design of the building was meant to resemble an integrated circuit,[2] while also evoking the look of a Gothic cathedral. It is the tallest city hall in the world. The other two buildings in the complex are the eight-story Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly Building (including one underground floor) and Tokyo Metropolitan Main Building No.2, which has 37 stories including three below ground. The two panoramic observation decks, one in each tower on floor 45 (202 meters [663 ft] high), are free of charge to the public and contain gift shops and cafes.[3] The observation decks are open between 9:30 – 23:00, but the two observation decks are open on alternate days .[4] Contents 1 History 2 See also 3 References 4 External links History[edit] The building was designed by Kenzo Tange and finished in December 1990 at the expense of ¥157 billion (about US$ 1 billion) of public money. It replaced the old city hall at Yūrakuchō, which was built in 1957 and also designed by Tange, is now the site of the Tokyo International Forum. It was the tallest building by roof height in Tokyo, at 242.9 meters [797 ft],[1] until the Midtown Tower was completed in 2007.
