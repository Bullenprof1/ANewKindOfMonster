Founded by a small group of industry professionals, including Peter Chiang (Senior VFX Supervisor), Matt Holben (Joint MD), Alex Hope (Joint MD) and Paul Franklin (Senior VFX Supervisor), Double Negative has grown from a small team in London to almost 5,000 members of staff worldwide. Over the years, Double Negative has worked on over 200 movies and developed working relationships with a number of leading directors. Its first project was Pitch Black, released in 2000. Since then, notable projects have included Enemy at the Gates, Batman Begins, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,[5] Children of Men, Inception, Iron Man 2, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, John Carter, Green Zone, Interstellar, Ex Machina, Spectre, Blade Runner 2049, Avengers: Infinity War and Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Double Negative's visual effects work has been honored with five Academy Awards, five BAFTAs and eight Visual Effects Society Awards. International expansion[edit] In 2009, Double Negative opened its Singapore office,[6][7] and closed it in March 2016.[8][9] The following year, Double Negative set up its Feature Animation division to deliver animated feature films from its headquarters in London, working alongside IP creators and filmmakers. Also in 2014, Double Negative merged with Prime Focus World;[10] the merged company was rebranded as DNEG.[11] The two companies announced the upcoming opening of a Mumbai branch following the merger.[12] Since 2014 DNEG has opened new facilities in Vancouver, Mumbai, Los Angeles, Chennai, Montréal, Chandigarh. TV VFX[edit] In April 2013 the company launched DNEG TV, a new division dedicated to the creation of VFX for television, designed to allow television producers and networks access to Double Negative's team and infrastructure for non-theatrical projects. Stereo conversion[edit] DNEG's stereo team (previously Prime Focus World) was the first in the world to convert a full Hollywood film from 2D to 3D and has since become one of the largest stereo conversion companies in the motion picture industry.[13] TV Shows[edit] Completed projects[edit] Agent Carter – Season 1,2 Altered Carbon Arthur & George Black Mirror – "Metalhead" Bluestone 42 – Series 3 BrainDead Childhood's End Death in Paradise – Series 3,4,5,7 Doctor Who - Series 11, 12[14] Emerald City Fungus the Bogeyman Harlots Home Fires – Series 1,2 Hootem & The Lady Jekyll & Hyde Krypton London Spy Love Nina Marvel's Inhumans Mr Selfridge – Series 2,3,4 Outlander Philip K.
