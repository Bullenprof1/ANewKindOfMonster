John Mitchell Kemble (2 April 1807 – 26 March 1857), English scholar and historian, was the eldest son of Charles Kemble the actor and Maria Theresa Kemble. He is known for his major contribution to the history of the Anglo-Saxons and philology of the Old English language, including one of the first translations of Beowulf.

He published Anglo-Saxon Poems of Beowulf (1833–1837), Über die Stammtafeln der Westsachsen (Munich 1836), Codex diplomaticus aevi Saxonici (London 1839–1848), and made many contributions to reviews; his History of the Saxons in England (1849; new ed. 1876) was based on original sources for the early period of English history. Kemble's "literal" Beowulf translation was entirely in prose.[4] Grendel reaches Heorot: Beowulf 710–714 Old English verse Kemble's prose Ðá cóm of móre | under misthleoþum Grendel gongan· | godes yrre bær· mynte se mánscaða | manna cynnes sumne besyrwan | in sele þám héan· Then under veils of mist came Grendel* from the moor; he bare God's anger, the criminal meant to entrap some one of the race of men in the high hall.  * The prose does not attempt to follow the original's order in words or phrases. He was editor of the British and Foreign Review from 1835 to 1844; and from 1840 to his death was Examiner of Plays. In 1857 he published State Papers and Correspondence Illustrative of the Social and Political State of Europe from the Revolution to the Accession of the House of Hanover. His Horae Ferales, or Studies in the Archaeology of Northern Nations was completed by Robert Gordon Latham, and published in 1864. Marriage and death[edit] Kemble married Nathalie Auguste, daughter of Amadeus Wendt of the University of Göttingen, in about 1836. They had two daughters and a son, but the marriage was not a happy one and they were living apart by about 1850.[5]:p.370 The elder daughter, Gertrude (b. 1837) married Sir Charles Santley, the singer, and died in 1882.[5]:p.371 Kemble died at Dublin on 26 March 1857 and is buried there in Mount Jerome Cemetery.
