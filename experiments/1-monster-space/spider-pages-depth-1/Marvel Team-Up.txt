The series featured two or more Marvel characters in one story. The series was originally published from March 1972 through February 1985, and featured Spider-Man as the lead "team-up" character in all but ten of its 150 issues, and in six of its seven Annuals. It was the first major ongoing spin-off series for Spider-Man, being preceded only by the short-lived The Spectacular Spider-Man magazine. Of the issues that did not star Spider-Man, the Human Torch headlines six issues (#18, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35); the Hulk, four (#97, 104, 105, and Annual #3); and Aunt May, one (#137). Publication of most of the issues starring the Human Torch coincided with that of Giant-Size Spider-Man, an alternate Spider-Man "team-up"-themed series by the regular Marvel Team-Up creative team. When cancelled with #150 in 1985, the title was replaced by Web of Spider-Man. The second series was published for 11 issues from September 1997 through July 1998 and originally featured Spider-Man; Namor the Sub-Mariner was the featured character starting with #8. From 1995 to 1997, a quarterly series titled Spider-Man Team-Up fulfilled much the same purpose as the original title. The third Marvel Team-Up series, written by Robert Kirkman, began publication in January 2005 and frequently featured Spider-Man. This volume often reintroduced lesser-known Marvel characters that had fallen into obscurity. The spirit of Marvel Team-Up was carried on by Avenging Spider-Man and later by Superior Spider-Man Team-Up.

The title's guest-stars were an equal mix of A-list characters whose presence was likely to increase sales and fledgling heroes being given exposure in the hopes of launching them into stardom but who for the most part continued to languish in obscurity.[1] The series debuted with a March 1972 cover-dated issue[2] featuring Spider-Man and the Human Torch in a story by writer Roy Thomas and artist Ross Andru.[3] Spider-Man and the Human Torch were originally the permanent headliners on the series, but the creators found this format limiting, and after just three issues the Human Torch was dropped in favor of a rotating co-star slot.[1] The main artists on the series for the first several years were Andru, Gil Kane, Sal Buscema, and Jim Mooney.[4] In 1974, Marvel started publishing Giant-Size Spider-Man, which was a quarterly 68-page comic that lasted for six issues which complemented Marvel Team-Up.[5] The series featured team-ups, with each issue featuring a new story with a back-up reprint, except the last issue, which only featured a reprint. Due to the limitations of the typically single-issue team-up stories, the supporting cast of Spider-Man's other titles rarely appeared in Marvel Team-Up.[1] The series often featured non-superhero characters in the co-star slot.[6] A multi-issue time travel story arc began in issue #41 with Spider-Man and the Scarlet Witch traveling to the Salem witch trials in 1692,[7] and pushed the barriers of continuity by having Spider-Man team up with two characters who had no established connection to the mainstream Marvel Universe, Killraven and Deathlok.[1] Though the series did often team Spider-Man with other highly popular characters, it regularly gave the co-star slot to obscure characters that the average reader was unlikely to even recognize, particularly during writer J. M. DeMatteis's run. DeMatteis recounted, "I was always attracted to the more obscure characters, mainly because they were ripe for exploration. You could crack them open and really develop them. ... I just looked at these fringe characters as more inviting than the mainstream, more established characters - who all had their set-in-stone continuity. I wanted room to play and those characters gave me all the room I wanted. And let's face it, our lead character was as mainstream as you can get, so the obscure ones made for a nice contrast."[1] With issue #47, the series had a crossover with Marvel Two-in-One #17, which featured the Thing.[8] Jean DeWolff was introduced as a supporting character in the Spider-Man/Iron Man story in issue #48.[9] John Byrne, who would later become the artist on The Uncanny X-Men, first drew the characters in Marvel Team-Up #53.[10] Byrne and his Uncanny X-Men collaborator, writer Chris Claremont worked together on several issues of Marvel Team-Up.[11] Captain Britain, a character created for Marvel UK, made his first appearance in an American comic book in Marvel Team-Up #65 (January 1978).[12] Karma, a character that later joined the New Mutants, was created by Claremont and artist Frank Miller in #100's lead story.[13] A photo cover by Eliot R. Brown was used for the Spider-Man/Captain America team-up in issue #128.[14] Though published for well over a decade, the series format never truly caught on with readers. Upon taking a serious look at sales figures for Marvel Team-Up, Marvel's editorial staff found that sales dramatically rose or fell with each issue depending solely on the popularity of that issue's co-star.[1] Taking this into consideration, Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter concluded that it would make more sense to have another Spider-Man solo series with guest stars appearing when the storyline and/or promotional needs called for it, rather than a team-up series which unnaturally forced guest-stars upon the story.[1] The series ended with issue #150 (February 1985),[2] to be replaced by Web of Spider-Man.[1] A Hulk and the Human Torch story written by Jack C. Harris and drawn by Steve Ditko in the 1980s that was intended for Marvel Team-Up was published by Marvel as Incredible Hulk and the Human Torch: From the Marvel Vault #1 in August 2011.[15][16] Spider-Man Team-Up was a brief attempt to revive the concept of the series[17][18] and was soon followed by Marvel Team-Up vol. 2 which was published from September 1997 to July 1998.[19] The third Marvel Team-Up series launched in January 2005 and ran for 25 issues[20] which starred a variety of characters.[21] The fourth series began with a June 2019 cover date and contains legacy numbering.[22] Marvel Team-Up[edit] Issue Character(s) Issue Character(s) Issue Character(s) #1 Spider-Man and the Human Torch vs. Sandman #51 Spider-Man and Iron Man vs. Wraith #101 Spider-Man and Nighthawk vs. Mindy Williams #2 Spider-Man and the Human Torch vs. the Frightful Four (Wizard, Sandman, Trapster) and Annihilus #52 Spider-Man and Captain America vs. Batroc the Leaper #102 Spider-Man and Doc Samson vs. Rhino #3 Spider-Man and the Human Torch vs. Morbius, the Living Vampire and Bert Tracker #53 Spider-Man and Hulk vs. Major Del Tremens #103 Spider-Man and Ant-Man vs. Taskmaster #4 Spider-Man and the X-Men (Angel, Cyclops, Iceman, and Marvel Girl)[23] vs. Morbius, the Living Vampire #54 Spider-Man and Hulk vs. Major Del Tremens #104 Hulk and Ka-Zar vs. MODOK #5 Spider-Man and the Vision vs. Puppet Master and Ballox the Monstroid #55 Spider-Man and Adam Warlock vs. Stranger #105 The Hulk, Power Man, and Iron Fist vs. Pa and Luther #6 Spider-Man and the Thing vs. Mad Thinker #56 Spider-Man and Daredevil vs. Electro and Blizzard #106 Spider-Man and Captain America vs. Scorpion #7 Spider-Man and Thor vs Kryllk the Cruel #57 Spider-Man and Black Widow vs. Silver Samurai #107 Spider-Man and She-Hulk vs. Man-Killer #8 Spider-Man and Cat vs. Man-Killer and A.I.M. #58 Spider-Man and Ghost Rider vs. Trapster #108 Spider-Man and Paladin vs. Thermo #9 Spider-Man and Iron Man vs. Zarrko the Tomorrow Man and Kang the Conqueror #59 Spider-Man, Yellowjacket and Wasp vs. Equinox #109 Spider-Man, Paladin, and Dazzler vs. Thermo #10 Spider-Man and Human Torch vs. Zarrko the Tomorrow Man and Kang the Conqueror #60 Spider-Man and Wasp vs. Equinox #110 Spider-Man and Iron Man vs. Magma #11 Spider-Man and the Inhumans (Black Bolt, Gorgon, Karnak the Shatterer, and Triton) vs. Zarrko the Tomorrow Man and Kang the Conqueror #61 Spider-Man and Human Torch vs. Super-Skrull #111 Spider-Man, the Defenders, and Devil-Slayer vs. Spider-God #12 Spider-Man and Werewolf by Night[24] vs. Moondark #62 Spider-Man and Ms. Marvel vs. Super-Skrull #112 Spider-Man and King Kull vs. Ju-Lak #13 Spider-Man and Captain America vs. Grey Gargoyle and A.I.M. #63 Spider-Man and Iron Fist vs. Steel Serpent #113 Spider-Man and Quasar vs. Lightmaster #14 Spider-Man and Namor the Sub-Mariner vs. Tiger Shark, Lemuel Dorcas, and the Aquanoids #64 Spider-Man and the Daughters of the Dragon vs. Steel Serpent #114 Spider-Man and Falcon vs. Stone-Face and Young Watchers #15 Spider-Man and Ghost Rider vs. Orb #65 Spider-Man and Captain Britain vs. Arcade #115 Spider-Man and Thor vs. Mind-Bender #16 Spider-Man and Captain Marvel vs. Basilisk #66 Spider-Man and Captain Britain vs. Arcade #116 Spider-Man, Thor, and Valkyrie vs. Mind-Bender and Shape-Changer #17 Spider-Man and Mister Fantastic vs. Mole Man and Basilisk #67 Spider-Man and Tigra vs. Kraven the Hunter #117 Spider-Man and Wolverine vs. Mentallo #18 Human Torch and Hulk vs. Blastaar, Paxton Pentecost, and Ferguson Blaine #68 Spider-Man and Man-Thing vs. D'Spayre #118 Spider-Man and Professor X vs. Mentallo #19 Spider-Man and Ka-Zar vs. Stegron the Dinosaur Man #69 Spider-Man and Havok vs. Living Pharaoh #119 Spider-Man and Gargoyle vs. some street thugs #20 Spider-Man and Black Panther vs. Stegron the Dinosaur Man #70 Spider-Man and Thor vs. Living Monolith #120 Spider-Man and Dominic Fortune vs. Turner D.
