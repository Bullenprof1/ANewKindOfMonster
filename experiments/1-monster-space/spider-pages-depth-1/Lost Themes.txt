It can be both great and bad to score over images, which is what I’m used to. Here there were no pressures. No actors asking me what they’re supposed to do. No crew waiting. No cutting room to go to. No release pending. It’s just fun. And I couldn’t have a better set-up at my house, where I depended on Cody [Carpenter] and Daniel [Davies] to bring me ideas as we began improvising. The plan was to make my music more complete and fuller, because we had unlimited tracks. I wasn’t dealing with just analogue anymore. It’s a brand new world. And there was nothing in any of our heads when we started other than to make it moody.[1] Critical reception[edit] Professional ratings Aggregate scores Source Rating Metacritic 74/100[3] Review scores Source Rating AllMusic [4] Consequence of Sound B[5] Exclaim! 8/10[6] Pitchfork 7.6/10[7] Popmatters [8] Rolling Stone [9] Uncut [10] Upon its release, Lost Themes received positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 74, which indicates "generally favorable reviews", based on 12 reviews.[3] Writing for AllMusic, Heather Phares stated that "a big part of Lost Themes' brilliance lies in Carpenter's refusal to update his aesthetic -- the more '80s it is, the more vital it sounds." She also further commented: "As he leaps from one thrill to the next, he evokes his past without rehashing it, delivering a complete and immensely satisfying portrait of his music along the way."[4] Consequence of Sound critic Dan Bogosian thought that "Carpenter’s limited instrumentation started as a strength," writing: "these Lost Themes could stand with any of his horror soundscapes."[5] Exclaim! critic Cam Lindsay described the album as "a brand new soundtrack that doesn't require a film" and observed: "Carpenter knows exactly how to appease his fans, and with Lost Themes, he has given them just what they want."[6] Aaron Leitko of Pitchfork wrote: "Lost Themes is plenty dark and heavy but shorter on inspiration."[7] Andy Beta of Rolling Stone was mixed in his assessment of the album, stating: "The icy synths of "Vortex" and "Fallen" evoke vintage Carpenter dread, but the prog-pomp of "Domain" and "Mystery" are the aural equivalent of too much CGI."[9] Charts[edit] The album debuted at number 44 on the UK Albums Chart.[11] Stateside, Lost Themes peaked at #129 on Billboard 200.[12] Track listing[edit] All music is composed by John Carpenter, Cody Carpenter and Daniel Davies.
