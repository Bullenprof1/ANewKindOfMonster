During the 1980s, the film industry began to flourish; many Chinese households did not have a TV at the time. Film served as the primary source of entertainment.[1] Many of the New Wave directors had a Western-style education and thus, were influenced by western filmmaking and culture.[2] The films of the New Wave, stylistically, lacked coherence; rather the term was used to make the distinction between new filmmakers and studio filmmaking.[3] These films utilized new technology, like synchronous sound, new editing techniques, and filming movies on location.[4] Second Wave[edit] In 1984, the New Wave began to gain attention from international audiences, thus prompting what became known as the "Second Wave". These directors include Stanley Kwan, Wong Kar-wai, Mabel Cheung, Alex Law, Fruit Chan, Peter Chan, and Tammy Cheung.[4] Major figures[edit] Alex Cheung[5] Tsui Hark (徐克)[6] Ann Hui (許鞍華)[7] Yim Ho (嚴浩)[8] Patrick Tam (譚家明)[9] Allen Fong (方育平)[10] Dennis Yu (余允抗)[11] Kirk Wong (黃志強)[12] John Woo (吳宇森)[13] Wong Kar-wai (王家衛)[14] Clifford Choi[15] Notable films[edit] A Better Tomorrow (John Woo, 1986)[16] References[edit] ^ Zhang, Yingjin (2004).
