There are three subplots: the monster's egg that is ready to hatch, a scientist who wants to capture the beast, and a mysterious sunken Nazi bomber plane which the military is trying to cover up. A Scottish scientist, George Sanderson, finds help from an American sonic expert, Spencer Dean, to team up and hunt for the monster. Along the journey, Spencer falls in love with Kathleen Stuart, who is the daughter of the first person to claim to take a photo of the monster, Jack Stuart. As these events are happening, a rival scientist, Professor Pratt, and his team are searching for the monster as well. Professor Pratt and his team end up finding a sunken World War II German bomber before retrieving the monster's egg. Although Professor Pratt and his team receive the monster's egg, the monster ends up killing his assistants, and Professor Pratt manages to successfully take the egg into his van. As Spencer and Sanderson attempt to locate the monster, Kathleen gets kidnapped by Professor Pratt. Kathleen is held captive while the monster goes on a killing spree in attempts to get her egg back. The monster's efforts are not successful, the monster is blown up, but her eggs are left to survive. Cast[edit] Miki MacKenzie Eric Scott Sandy Kenyon Barry Buchanan Production[edit] The film was made on an infamously low budget and on location at Lake Tahoe, California, whose surrounding countryside passes poorly for Scotland. The firearms used were 1 Colt Python and 2 M16s.[citation needed] Release[edit] It was released on 1 January 1981 under MPAA rating of PG.[2] Reception[edit] The limited release of this motion picture was poorly received. Its rating on IMDb is 2.6 out of 10, from 262 viewer votes.[3] The Loch Ness Horror is a 1981 horror movie directed by Larry Buchanan, who had a reputation for helming poorly-made films and even proclaiming himself the "schlockmeister".[citation needed] The film is infamous for its poor special effects, meandering story, awful use of California doubling for Scotland and the fact that, as with almost all of his films, Larry Buchanan uses members of his family both in front of the camera and behind it, whether they are suited to the task or not. The Nessie puppet (just a head on a stick) was later used as Jack the Ripper in one of the "Bullshit or Not?" segments in Amazon Women on the Moon.
