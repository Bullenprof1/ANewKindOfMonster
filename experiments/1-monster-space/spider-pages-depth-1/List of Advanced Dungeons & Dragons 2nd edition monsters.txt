Dungeons & Dragons game featured both a higher number of books of monsters[4] and more extensive monster descriptions than earlier[1] and later editions, with usually one page in length.[5][6][7][8][9]:106–107 Next to a description, monster entries in this edition contained standardized sections covering combat, their habit and society, and their role in the eco-system.[5][6] 2nd edition also used a unique format in the form of Monstrous Compendiums of loose sheets that could be collected in a folder, and allowed the combination of monster books together with individual monster pages from boxed sets.[5][9]:106–107[1] This format was abandoned again in 1993 in favor of bound books.[6][10] In parallel with this change, 2nd edition introduced colored images for each monster, which became standard in later editions of the game.[6][8][11] Monsters created for the 2nd edition were based on mythologies of various cultures, fantasy literature, and original inventions.[1] They were often updated from earlier editions. 2nd edition also introduced a great number of new creatures.[6][7] Some types, such as devils and demons, were initially removed by TSR in response to a moral panic promoted by Patricia Pulling's advocacy group Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons (BADD).[12][13][14] These were later reintroduced, sometimes with different names, to avoid complaints.[15] TSR 2102 – MC1 – Monstrous Compendium Volume One (1989)[edit] TSR 2102 – MC1 – Monstrous Compendium Volume One (1989) – ISBN 0-88038-738-6 This was the initial volume in the Monstrous Compendium series, for the second edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game, published in 1989. Most of the monsters for Volume One were taken from previous first edition AD&D books; the monster entries were greatly expanded and in most cases each monster now filled an entire page and had an all-new illustration. The Monstrous Compendium series consisted of a pack of 5-hole punched loose-leaf pages rather than an actual book, designed to be arranged to the player's preference. Volume One of the Monstrous Compendium was packaged in a box, which contained the pack of monster sheets as well as a binder intended to store the sheets for Volumes One, Two, and Three. The pack consisted of 144 pages, unnumbered, and included a "How To Use This Book" page, with an alphabetical index to Volume One on the back, four pages of monster summoning and random encounter charts, and a blank monster sheet to be photocopied, with the remainder consisting of the monster descriptions. Also included were eight full-page illustrations on heavier card stock. Note: All monsters from MC1 appeared in the Monstrous Manual (1993), though some had slightly altered headings.

Creature of enormous powers, where only the skull remains.[33] Ranked strongest among Screen Rant's "10 Most Powerful (And 10 Weakest) Monsters, Ranked", saying "You might think that a floating skull would be easy to smash to pieces, but you would be wrong, as demiliches are some of the most resilient creatures in the game."[34] Lizard Fire, Giant, Minotaur and Subterranean lizards Lizard man Greyhawk, Monster Manual (1977), Fiend Folio (1981), Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set, Dungeons & Dragons Game, Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia (1991), Classic Dungeons & Dragons Game (1994), Dungeons & Dragons Adventure Game (1999), Hollow World Campaign Set, Monstrous Manual, Dragonlance Monstrous Compendium, The Complete Spacefarer's Handbook, The Complete Book of Humanoids, Player's Option: Skills & Powers, Mind Lords of the Last Sea, Polyhedron No. 121 (1996), Monster Manual (2000), Races of Faerûn, Monster Manual (2003), Dragon No. 318 (2004), Serpent Kingdoms, Eberron Campaign Setting, Monster Manual III (2004), Dragon No. 335 (2005), Monster Manual IV (2006), Monster Manual (2008), Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, Monster Manual (2014), Volo's Guide to Monsters Lizard Man, Lizard King Lizardfolk are primitive reptilian humanoids typically standing from six to seven feet tall.

Depiction of the werewolf is related to those in 1930s and 1940s Hollywood movies like The Wolf Man.[1] Ranked sixth among the ten best low-level monsters by the authors of Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies: "a classic monster", interesting due to shapechanging because "players can never be entirely sure whether that surly villager might indeed be the great black wolf who attacked their characters out in the forest."[38] Manticore Medusa Normal and Greater Based on the creature from classical sources[1][3] but translated into race of monsters originated from "humans seeking eternal youth".[20] Men Aborigines/Cavemen, Adventurers, Bandits/Brigands, Barbarians/Nomads, Berserkers/Dervishes, Farmers/Herders, Gentry, Knights, Mercenary Soldiers, Merchant Sailors/Fishermen, Merchants/Traders, Middle Class, Peasantry (serfs), Pilgrims, Pirates/Buccaneers, Police/Constabulary, Priests, Sailors, Slavers, Soldiers, Thieves/Thugs, Tradesmen/Craftsmen, Tribesmen, and Wizards Mind flayer "Squid-headed humanoids", considered one of "the game's signature monsters" by Philip J.

Oozes/slimes/jellies Ochre Jelly, Gray Ooze, Crystal Ooze, Gelatinous cube and Green Slime "D&D's large variety of monstrous oozes and slimes took their original inspiration form Irvin S. Yeathworth Jr's The Blob" movie. In the artificial dungeon environment of the game, they function as a "clean up crew".

Tolkien's works.[1] Considered one of the "five main "humanoid" races" in AD&D by Paul Karczag and Lawrence Schick.[9]:92 Presented as "evil" and "savage raiders" in the game.[18]:48, 95 Owl Normal, Giant and Talking Owlbear Pegasus Winged horse.

The skeleton was ranked second among the ten best low-level monsters by the authors of Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies: "introduces players to the special advantages and weaknesses of undead monsters". They also thank Ray Harryhausen for people knowing what fighting skeletons ought to look like.[38] Screen Rant ranked the tiny skeleton one of the weakest D&D creatures, saying "[skeletons] go all the way down to Tiny-sized creatures, which means that it is possible for your party of adventurers to fight a group of skeletons that are the same size as action figures."[34] Skunk Normal and Giant Snake Constrictor (Normal and Giant), Poisonous (Normal and Giant), Giant Sea and Giant Spitting Snakes Spectre Spider Large, Huge, Giant, Giant Water, Giant Marine and Phase Spiders Phase spider: Arachnid as big as a medium-large dog that can shift between dimensions and bite with fangs of deadly poison.[23]:148–149 Sprite Toad, giant Giant, Fire, Ice and Poisonous Toads Treant Based on the Ent by J.

Unicorn Based on the creature from medieval bestiaries.[1] Vampire Depiction is related to those in 1930s and 1940s Hollywood Dracula movies.[1] Wight Directly adapted from the creature of the same name in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.[1] Will o'wisp Wolf Wolf, Dire Wolf (Worg), Winter wolf Wolfwere Wraith Wyvern Yeti Yuan-ti Zombie Common, Monster and Ju-Ju Zombie TSR 2103 – MC2 – Monstrous Compendium Volume Two (1989)[edit] TSR 2103 – MC2 – Monstrous Compendium Volume Two (1989) – ISBN 0-88038-753-X This was the second volume in the Monstrous Compendium series, for the second edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, published in 1989. As with Volume One, most of the monsters for Volume Two were taken from previous first edition AD&D books, with greatly expanded entries that now filled an entire page and had an all-new illustration. Volume Two was packaged in a wraparound cover, and the pages were designed to fit in the binder that came with Volume One of the Monstrous Compendium.

The githyanki/illithid relationship was inspired by Larry Niven's World of Ptavvs.[62][63] Githzerai 48-49 Monstrous Compendium – Outer Planes Appendix (1991), Monstrous Manual (1993) Designed by Charles Stross[60] Grue – Earth/Fire 50-51 Al-Qadim – Secrets of the Lamp (1993) Chaggrin and Harginn Grue – Air/Water 52-53 Al-Qadim – Secrets of the Lamp (1993) Ildriss and Varrdig Hordling 54-55 Monstrous Compendium – Outer Planes Appendix (1991) Imp 56-57 Monstrous Manual (1993) Imp and Quasit Incarnates 58-61 Larva 62-63 Monstrous Compendium – Outer Planes Appendix (1991) Maelephant 64-65 Monstrous Compendium – Outer Planes Appendix (1991) Marut 66-67 Monstrous Compendium – Outer Planes Appendix (1991) Mediator 68-69 Monstrous Compendium – Outer Planes Appendix (1991) (as Mediator and Translator) Mechanus Mediator and translator Mephit 70 Monstrous Manual (1993) (as Imp, Mephit) Mephit, Air/Smoke 71 Monstrous Compendium – Fiend Folio Appendix (1992) (Smoke Mephit), Monstrous Manual (1993) (Smoke Mephit) Air and Smoke Mephit Mephit, Earth/Ooze 72 Earth and Ooze Mephit Mephit, Fire/Radiant 73 Monstrous Compendium – Fiend Folio Appendix (1992) (Fire Mephit), Monstrous Manual (1993) (Fire Mephit) Fire and Radiant Mephit Mephit, Water/Ice 74 Monstrous Compendium – Fiend Folio Appendix (1992) (Ice Mephit), Monstrous Manual (1993) (Ice Mephit) Water and Ice Mephit Mephit, Dust/Salt 75 Dust and Salt Mephit Mephit, Lightning/Mineral 76 Lightning and Mineral Mephit Mephit, Magma/Ash 77 Monstrous Compendium – Fiend Folio Appendix (1992) (Magma as Lava Mephit), Monstrous Manual (1993) (Magma as Lava Mephit) Magma and Ash Mephit Mephit, Mist/Steam 78 Monstrous Compendium – Fiend Folio Appendix (1992), Monstrous Manual (1993) (as Imp, Mephit) Mist and Steam Mephit Nighthag 80-81 Monstrous Compendium – Outer Planes Appendix (1991) (as Night Hag) Nightmare 82-83 Monstrous Compendium – Outer Planes Appendix (1991), Monstrous Manual (1993) Per 84 Monstrous Compendium – Outer Planes Appendix (1991) Shadow Fiend 86 Monstrous Compendium – Ravenloft Appendix I (1991), Ravenloft Monstrous Compendium Appendices I & II (1996) Slaad 88-91 Monstrous Compendium – Outer Planes Appendix (1991), Monstrous Manual (1993) (Gray and Death by reference only) Red, Blue, Green, Gray and Death Slaad Tanar'ri 92-93 Monstrous Compendium – Outer Planes Appendix (1991), Monstrous Manual (1993) Renamed from demons in response to moral panic,[15] many were based on figures from Christian demonology.[60] Considered among the "standard repertoire of "Monsters"" by Fabian Perlini-Pfister.[3] Tanar'ri, Lesser – Alu-Fiend 94 Monstrous Compendium – Outer Planes Appendix (1991) Tanar'ri, Greater – Babau 95 Monstrous Compendium – Outer Planes Appendix (1991) Tanar'ri, True – Balor 96 Monstrous Compendium – Outer Planes Appendix (1991), Monstrous Manual (1993) Based on and renamed from the Balrog from J.R.R.

Unlike the previous annuals, the included monsters are not primarily drawn from the previous year's publications, but span a wide variety of years, possibly because TSR's financial woes resulted in very few products being produced in 1997. Also in a departure from the first three annuals, Volume Four includes a reference to the original appearance of the creature on each page. The Annual also contains a 3-page "How to Use This Book" section, which includes updated tables for the calculation of experience points awarded for defeating various creatures, and a 2-page index.
