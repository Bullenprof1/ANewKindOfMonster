Japanese video game director Hidetaka Miyazaki 宮崎 英高 Born 1974 or 1975 (age 45–47) Shizuoka, Japan Nationality Japanese Alma mater Keio University Occupation Creative director game designer writer business executive Notable credit(s) Souls series Bloodborne Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice Title President of FromSoftware, Inc. Term 2014–present Awards Lifetime Achievement (2018 Golden Joystick Awards) Hidetaka Miyazaki (宮崎 英高, Miyazaki Hidetaka, born c. 1975) is a Japanese video game director, designer, writer, and company president of FromSoftware. He originally joined the company in 2004 as a game designer for the Armored Core series, later becoming known for creating the Souls series, starting with Demon's Souls in 2009. Other games he has worked on include Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Miyazaki's influences range from the works of various novelists, mangakas, and other game designers such as Fumito Ueda and Yuji Horii, as well as Asian and European architecture. Miyazaki's games, particularly the Souls series, often invoke the use of high difficulty, strong visual and environmental storytelling, and a large amount of setting and character background information provided through mostly vague flavor text. His work in the Souls series has been seen as influential, with him winning awards and being cited as an auteur of video games.

Using his imagination to fill in the blanks by using the accompanying illustrations, Miyazaki used this as inspiration for some of his later ideas on video game design.[1] Alongside this, he was restricted from playing video games by his parents until he was old enough to attend university, so he instead played gamebooks and tabletop games such as Steve Jackson's Sorcery! and Dungeons & Dragons.[2] Career[edit] After graduating from Keio University with a degree in social science, Miyazaki went to work doing account managing for the US based Oracle Corporation.[1][3] Upon a friend's recommendation, Miyazaki began playing the 2001 video game Ico, causing him to consider a career change to a game designer.[1] At age 29 however, Miyazaki found that few game companies would employ him, with one of the few being FromSoftware, where Miyazaki began working as a game planner on Armored Core: Last Raven in 2004, joining the game's development halfway through.[1][3] Miyazaki later directed Armored Core 4 and its direct sequel, Armored Core: For Answer.[3] Upon learning about what later became Demon's Souls, Miyazaki became excited at the prospect of a fantasy action role-playing game and offered to help.[1] The project, up until Miyazaki was assigned to it, was considered a failure by the company, with Miyazaki stating "I figured if I could find a way to take control of the game, I could turn it into anything I wanted. Best of all, if my ideas failed, nobody would care – it was already a failure."[1] Although the game was received negatively at the 2009 Tokyo Game Show and sold far under expectations upon release, it began to pick up after a few months and soon found publishers willing to release the title outside of Japan.[1] After the release and success of the game's spiritual successor Dark Souls in 2011, Miyazaki was promoted to the position of company president in May 2014.[4][5] In Japan it was unprecedented for a person to change career and become company president within 10 years.[1] After the release of the Prepare to Die edition of Dark Souls in August 2012, Sony Computer Entertainment approached FromSoftware concerning cooperative development on a new title. Miyazaki asked about the possibility of developing a game for eighth-generation consoles, and the concept of Bloodborne developed from there. There were no story or setting connections to FromSoftware's previous games, even though Miyazaki conceded that it carried the "DNA" of Demon's Souls and its specific level design.[2] Development ran parallel to that of Dark Souls II, which Miyazaki supervised only as he was unable to direct both games simultaneously.[6] After the release of Bloodborne in March 2015, Miyazaki returned to the Souls series as the director on Dark Souls III (2016), with assistance from Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor and Dark Souls II directors Isamu Okano and Yui Tanimura, respectively.[7][8] After its release, Miyazaki stated his intentions to personally stop development on the Souls series.[9][10] His next two projects were the 2018 virtual reality game Déraciné and the 2019 action-adventure game Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.[11][12] At the 2018 Golden Joystick Awards ceremony, he was awarded the show's Lifetime Achievement Award for his contributions to the video game industry.[13] The award was presented to him by Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson, two of his design influences.[14] Miyazaki is also set to direct the action role-playing game Elden Ring, written in collaboration with A Song of Ice and Fire series author George R. R. Martin.[15] Influences and design philosophy[edit] Miyazaki is often inspired by the designs of real world architecture, using them as a part of environmental storytelling in his games. One such example is Anor Londo, a central location in Dark Souls, being modeled after the Château de Chambord in France (left) and Milan Cathedral in Italy (right). Miyazaki's influences include video games such as Ico,[1] the early Dragon Quest games,[16][17] and The Legend of Zelda[16][18] and King's Field video game series,[19] manga series such as Berserk, Saint Seiya, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,[20] and Devilman,[18] the literary works of H. P. Lovecraft, Bram Stoker, and George R. R. Martin,[18][21][22] and gamebooks such as Steve Jackson's Sorcery! and RuneQuest.[18][23] Miyazaki is also inspired by architecture, especially of Europe, and often uses it as a way of environmental storytelling.[24][25][26][27] Psychology, sociology, and the history of humanity have also influenced his design philosophy.[2] The multiplayer mechanics of the Souls series were inspired by his own personal experience of driving up on a snowy road as cars ahead began slipping back and were pushed up hill by other people in the area. As Miyazaki was unable to give his appreciation to them before leaving the area, he wondered whether the last person in the line had made it to their destination, thinking that he would probably never meet them again. This gave birth to the series' interconnected multiplayer systems, with it attempting to emulate that same sense of silent cooperation in the face of adversity.[28] Miyazaki stated that the notable difficulty of the Souls series had no intention of being more difficult than other games. Rather, the difficulty was a part of the process that gives players a sense of accomplishment by "overcoming tremendous odds", while also having a certain level of difficulty incentivizing players to experiment more with character builds and weapons.[25] He stated that death in his games are meant to be used as a trial and error learning tool, adding that the idea was only accepted by players following the success of Demon's Souls.[29] When asked about his style of storytelling, Miyazaki stated that he does not dislike direct storytelling despite what others may believe, but rather prefers players to interpret the world for themselves as they get more value from it when find out hints of plot from items or side-characters they encounter in the world.[25] Many gaming journalists and critics have called him an "auteur" of video games, noting his influential work in the Souls series that has gone on to influence other game designers.[30][31][32] Personal life[edit] Miyazaki has a son who was born sometime in the late 2010s.[33] Works[edit] Year Title Role 2005 Armored Core: Last Raven Planner 2006 Armored Core 4 Director 2008 Armored Core: For Answer 2009 Demon's Souls 2011 Dark Souls Director, producer 2014 Dark Souls II Supervisor 2015 Bloodborne Director 2016 Dark Souls III 2018 Déraciné 2019 Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice TBA Elden Ring References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i j k Parkin, Simon.
