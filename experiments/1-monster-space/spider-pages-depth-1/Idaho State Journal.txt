On January 6, 1993 it became a newspaper with a weekly printing. Over the ensuing years it increased publication to twice weekly, and then thrice weekly. In March 1897 a failed attempt was made print daily editions. However, that endeavor became successful several years later and the newspaper has published daily since March 17, 1902.[4][5] On April 28, 1924, the Idaho State Journal began publication, but the Pocatello Tribune purchased that periodical in 1932. Thereafter, the Idaho State Journal continued as the morning edition of the Pocatello Tribune. However, due to the newsprint shortages durning World War II, printing of the Idaho State Journal was suspended in 1942. Like many others newspapers, the Idaho State Journal changed ownership multiple times during its early existence.[4][5] The current Idaho State Journal became a reality on October 1, 1949, when it merged with another newspaper (the Pocatello Post), which had begun in 1947. By then, the newspaper was owned by the Scripps League Newspapers. After several changes in operating sites, the newspaper moved to its currently location on South Arthur Avenue in 1951. Over three decade later, Scripps League Newspapers sold its interest in the newspaper to the Pioneer News Group in 1984.[4][5] More than another three decades later, the Pioneer New Group sold its papers to Adams Publishing Group in 2017.[6] See also[edit] List of newspapers in Idaho References[edit] ^ a b c d "Contact". idahostatejournal.com.
