The Reflector Type Weekly newspaper Owner(s) Lafromboise Communications Founded 1909; 112 years ago (1909) Circulation 28,040[1] The Reflector is a weekly newspaper that provides coverage of Battle Ground, Washington in the United States and is the legal newspaper of the City of Battle Ground.[2][3] The first issue of The Reflector – then located in Ridgefield, Washington – was published on October 8, 1909 by Kelley Loe who shortly thereafter sold it to Ellis B. Hall.[4][5] In 1946, The Reflector was merged with an existing newspaper in Battle Ground, The Mid-County Record, to become The Mid-County Reflector, later shortened to The Reflector.[6][7] The headquarters moved to Battle Ground in 1959.[citation needed] In 2010 The Reflector was purchased by Lafromboise Communications from its owner of the previous 30 years, Marvin Case.[8][1] After 100 years of local ownership, it was purchased in 2010 by Lafromboise Communications Inc., a publisher based in Centralia, Washington, 80 miles to the north. At that time, it had a free home delivery circulation of 26,500.[7] Steve Walker, formerly of the Lewis County Daily Chronicle, took over as publisher.[9] The name Reflector comes from a tradition including similar newspaper titles like "Mirror." Norwalk, Ohio and Greenville, North Carolina also have newspapers called the Reflector.[10] References[edit] ^ a b Bagwell, Steve; Stapilus, Randy (2013).
