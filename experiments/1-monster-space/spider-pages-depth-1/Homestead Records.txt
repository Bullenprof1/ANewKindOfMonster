The label was known for not paying its artists and not spending any money on promotion.[1] Contents 1 History 2 Artists 3 See also 4 References 5 External links History[edit] The label was created by Barry Tenenbaum. Tenenbaum started a mail-order business, called Lord Sitar Records, from his bedroom when he was a teenager, importing records by the Beatles and other artists from England that he could sell for a profit in the States. Tenenbaum had established an extensive distribution network, called Dutch East India Trading, so when the Copyright Act of 1976 curtailed his ability to import artists who already had U.S. labels, he began licensing records for release and he created the Homestead Records imprint for this purpose. Sam Berger, who worked for Dutch East, became the new label's first manager.[1] Sam Berger left Homestead the following in 1984 and was replaced by Gerard Cosloy, the creator of the underground art fanzine Conflict. Cosloy would be the sole employee of the label until 1987 when Craig Marks was hired to assist him in running the label. Cosloy and Marks both resigned in 1990. Ken Katkin was the manager from 1990 to 1992, and Steven Joerg from 1992 to 1996. The label closed in 1996 with its last release being Ivo Perelman's Cama de Terra.[1][2][3] Artists[edit] Antietam[2] Babe the Blue Ox Bastro Beat Happening Beat Temptation Big Black Big Dipper Bloodsport Bodeco Brainiac Bratmobile Breaking Circus Bull David S.
