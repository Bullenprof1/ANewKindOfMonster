The Auloniad (/əˈloʊniæd/; Αὐλωνιάς from the classical Greek αὐλών "valley, ravine") was a nymph who could be found in mountain pastures and vales, often in the company of Pan, the god of nature. Eurydice, for whom Orpheus traveled into dark Hades, was an Auloniad, and it was in the valley of the Thessalian river Pineios where she met her death, indirectly, at the hands of Aristaeus. Aristaeus, son of the god Apollo and the nymph Cyrene, desired to ravish Eurydice. Either disgust or fear made the nymph run away from him without looking where she was going. Eurydice trod on a poisonous serpent and died.[1] References[edit] ^ Virgil, Georgica, 4.453ff External links[edit] Theoi Project - Dryades & Oreiades This article relating to a Greek deity is a stub.
