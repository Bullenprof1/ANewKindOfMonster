Wikipedia list article Anti-war films criticize armed conflicts in a general sense to illustrate that war is futile, and a loss for all sides involved, while others focus on acts within a specific war, such as the use of poison gas or the genocidal killing of civilians. Then there are those anti-war movies that employ parody and black comedy to satirize wars and conflicts, which don't necessarily take place on the battlefield. There are also non-fictional anti-war films that document the reality of war or historical events. The following is a list of anti-war films.
