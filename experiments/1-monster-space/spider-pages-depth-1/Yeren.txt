Alleged Chinese creature For the "people of the field" of the Zhou dynasty, see Yeren (Zhou dynasty). Inscription at the entrance to the "Yeren Cave" in western Hubei Province. The Yeren (Chinese: 野人; pinyin: yěrén; lit. 'wild-man'), in Chinese folklore, is a purported ape-like creature said to reside in the remote mountainous forested regions of western Hubei, China.[1][2] Supposed evidence of the creature's existence is based on anecdotal accounts and alleged footprints, hair, and feces.[3] Much like other creatures of similar descriptions in Asia such as the Yeti and Almas; and North America's Bigfoot, mainstream science largely discredits the existence of such an animal, attributing it to a combination of hoax, misidentification, and folklore.

'The Wildman of Shennongjia') or Man-Monkey (Chinese: 人熊; pinyin: Ren Xiong; lit. 'Man Bear'). The human-like footprints allegedly left by the creature have been recorded as being between 280 millimetres (11 in) and 460 millimetres (18 in) in length.[6] History[edit] Accounts of the Yeren's existence go back about 3,000 years, with approximately 400 reported sightings in the Shennongjia nature reserve.[7] In 1976, Communist party officials reported encountering the creature[8], leading to the 1977 government-funded Chinese Academy of Sciences investigation. A team lead by Paleontology Professor Guoxing Zhou of the Beijing Natural History Museum was tasked with gathering eyewitness reports, hair, and footprints. Nothing of evidentiary substance was recovered.[9] In 2012, Prof. Guoxing concluded that footprints were likely created by bears; Paleoanthropology expert Wu Xinzhi echoed much of the same, indicating Shennongjia likely could not support a species of great ape.[10] Some have argued that the creatures may be surviving Gigantopithecus, an extinct great ape that once inhabited the region.[8] Today, Hubei capitalizes on the creature's infamy to attract tourists to remote villages within the province.[11][12] A statue depicting a female Yeren and her child exists within the nature preserve, serving as another popular tourist attraction.[13] In popular culture[edit] Wildman of China is Monster in My Pocket #119.[citation needed] The Chinese Wild Man shows up in John Carpenter's 1986 film Big Trouble in Little China.[citation needed] Yerens appear as monsters in the Iron Lore Entertainment video game Titan Quest. They can be found in Act III (Orient mission) of the game.[citation needed] Syfy's show Destination Truth searched for the Yeren in episode 12 of season 3.[citation needed] Animal Planet's show Finding Bigfoot searched for the Yeren in episode 5 of season 4 "Kung Fu Bigfoot".[citation needed] Parcast's podcast series "Unexplained Mysteries" produced an episode focused on the creature in 2019.[citation needed] See also[edit] Orang Mawas Orang Pendek Hibagon References[edit] ^ Frank Dikötter (1997).
