Skelton, 1908 Further information: Translating Beowulf Alexander states that his verse translation of Beowulf imitated the form of the original, "stimulated by the example of Ezra Pound's version of [the Old English poem] 'The Seafarer'".[3] The scholar Hugh Magennis calls Alexander's translation "accessible but not reductive", notes that it sold "hundreds of thousands" of copies and that it was liked by both students and teachers, and devotes a whole chapter of his book on translating Beowulf to it.[4] Grendel reaches Heorot: Beowulf 710–714 Old English verse Alexander's verse Ðá cóm of móre | under misthleoþum Grendel gongan· | godes yrre bær· mynte se mánscaða | manna cynnes sumne besyrwan | in sele þám héan· Down off the moorlands' twisting fells came Grendel stalking; God's brand was on him. The spoiler meant to snatch away from the high hall some of human race.
