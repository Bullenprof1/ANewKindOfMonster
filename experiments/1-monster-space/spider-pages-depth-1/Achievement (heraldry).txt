Supporters (if the bearer is entitled to them, generally in modern usage not baronets), which may stand on a Compartment) Motto, if possessed Order, if possessed Badge, if possessed Contents 1 Coat of arms 2 Hatchment 3 References 4 External links Coat of arms[edit] Sometimes the term "coat of arms" is used to refer to the full achievement, but this usage is wrong in the strict sense of heraldic terminology, as a coat of arms refers to a garment with the escutcheon or armorial achievement embroidered on it.[3][4] Hatchment[edit] Garter stall plate of John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford (c. 1485–1554/5), installed as a Knight of the Garter 18 May 1539, showing his "achievement", at that time termed "hatchment" The ancient term used in place of "achievement" was "hatchment", being a corruption (through such historic forms as atcheament, achement, hathement, etc.) of the French achèvement,[5] from the verb achever, a contraction of à chef venir ("to come to a head"), ultimately from Latin ad caput venire, "to come to a head",[6] thus to reach a conclusion, accomplish, achieve. The word "hatchment" in its historical usage is thus identical in meaning and origin to the English heraldic term "achievement". However, in recent years the word "hatchment" has come to be used almost exclusively to denote "funerary hatchment", whilst "achievement" is now used in place of "hatchment" in a non-funereal context. An example of the historic use of "hatchment" in a non-funerary context to denote what is now termed "achievement" is in the statute of the Order of the Garter laid down by King Henry VIII (1509–1547) concerning the regulation of Garter stall plates:[7] It is agreed that every knyght within the yere of his stallation shall cause to be made a scauchon of his armes and hachementis in a plate of metall suche as shall please him and that it shall be surely sett upon the back of his stall.
