Of the Classical writers, the first and perhaps only poet to reference alseids is Homer. Rather than alseid he used the spelling alsea. The three uses of alsea by Homer are as follows: "The nymphs who live in the lovely groves (ἄλσεα - alsea), and the springs of rivers (πηγαὶ ποταμῶν - pegai potamon) and the grassy meadows (πίσεα ποιήεντα - pisea poiëenta)."[1] "They [nymphs] come from springs (krênai), they come from groves (alsea), they come from the sacred rivers (ποταμοί - potamoi) flowing seawards."[2] "The nymphs [of Mount Ida] who haunt the pleasant woods (alsea), or of those who inhabit this lovely mountain (ὄρος - oros) and the springs of rivers (pegai potamon) and grassy meads (pisea)."[3] Alseids in popular culture[edit] Alseids have been featured in Magic: The Gathering's Greek-themed world of Theros on the cards Alseid of Life's Bounty, Harvestguard Alseids, and Observant Alseid.
