For films named Heist, see Heist (disambiguation) § Film. The heist film or caper film is a subgenre of crime film, consisting of films that tell a caper story. These films feature plots in which a team of skillful criminals carry out a clever and daring theft.[1] Early films in the genre tended to have the heist ultimately fail, as a result of the strictures imposed by the Motion Picture Production Code; since the abandonment of the Production Code, most caper films feature successful heists.[1] One of the early defining heist films was The Asphalt Jungle (1950), which Film Genre 2000 wrote "almost single-handedly popularised the genre for mainstream cinema". It featured robbers whose personal failings ultimately led to the failure of their robbery. Similar films using this formula were Armored Car Robbery (1950), The Killing (1956), and The Getaway (1972). By the 1990s, heist films "experiment and play with these conventions" and focused more on character relationships than the crime itself.[2] List of notable heist films[edit] See also: Category:Heist films Film Year Ref. 11 Harrowhouse 1974 [3] 80 Million 2011 [4] Armored Car Robbery 1950 [2] The Asphalt Jungle 1950 [5] Baby Driver 2017 [6] Bande à part 1964 [5] The Bank Job 2008 [6] Big Deal on Madonna Street 1958 [7] Blue Collar 1978 [8] Bob le flambeur 1956 [8] Bonnie and Clyde 1967 [9] Bottle Rocket 1996 [6] The Castle of Cagliostro 1979 Le Cercle Rouge 1970 [5] Dead Presidents 1995 [10] Den of Thieves 2018 [11] Le deuxième souffle 1966 [8] Dog Day Afternoon 1975 [5] Entrapment 1999 [12] Fast Five 2011 [6] A Fish Called Wanda 1988 [6] Flawless 2007 [3] The Getaway 1972 [8] Going in Style 2017 [13] Grand Slam 1967 [8] Heat 1995 [6] The Hatton Garden Job 2017 [6] Heist 2001 [14] Hell or High Water 2016 [15] The Hot Rock 1972 [3] How to Steal a Million 1966 [8] Hudson Hawk 1991 [16] Inception 2010 [5] Inside Man 2006 [6] The Italian Job 1969 [6] The Italian Job 2003 [6] Jackie Brown 1997 [9] The Killing 1956 [6] King of Thieves 2018 [17] The Lavender Hill Mob 1951 [8] Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels 1998 [6] Logan Lucky 2017 [6] Now You See Me 2013 [13] Ocean's 8 2018 [8] Ocean's 11 1960 [7] Ocean's Eleven 2001 [5] Ocean's Twelve 2004 [8] Ocean's Thirteen 2007 [18] Out of Sight 1998 [9] Point Break 1991 [6] Quick Change 1990 [9] Reservoir Dogs 1992 [5] Rififi 1955 [5] Ronin 1998 [9] The Score 2001 [19] Set It Off 1996 [6] Sexy Beast 2000 [5] Snatch 2000 [6] Sneakers 1992 [20] The Split 1968 [21] The Sting 1973 [6] Thief 1981 [5] The Thomas Crown Affair 1968 [6] The Thomas Crown Affair 1999 [6] Three Kings 1999 [9] Topkapi 1964 [7] The Town 2010 [6] The Usual Suspects 1995 [6] Vinci 2004 [4] Widows 2018 [5] References[edit] ^ a b Hardy, Phil, ed.
