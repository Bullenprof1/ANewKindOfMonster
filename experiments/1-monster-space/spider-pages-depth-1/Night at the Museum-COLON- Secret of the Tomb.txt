With the group is a young Cecil "C.J" Fredericks, who accidentally falls into the tomb and discovers the Tablet of Ahkmenrah. As the rest of the team starts packing up the artifacts due to an incoming sandstorm, the locals warn the group that if they remove the tablet from the tomb, then "the end will come." In present-day New York City, Larry Daley remains the night guard of the American Museum of Natural History. He and the other exhibits are hosting an event to help re-open the Hayden Planetarium. As Larry makes sure everything is in place for the event, the other exhibits inform him that the museum commissioned a new Neanderthal model that resembles Larry. The new Neanderthal takes the name Laaa and identifies Larry as his father. Later, Ahkmenrah pulls Larry aside and shows him that the tablet is suffering from a mysterious corrosion. That night, as Teddy Roosevelt speaks before a crowd of donors, the corrosion spreads on the tablet, causing all of the exhibits to act abnormally and cause massive chaos at the planetarium. After finally calming everyone down, Larry returns home frustrated and catches his now teenage son Nick throwing a house party. To try and figure out what is going on with the tablet, Larry reunites with the now retired Cecil, who he discovered was part of the expedition who discovered the tomb. Cecil remembers "the end will come" prophecy and realizes that it was referring to the end of the tablet's magic, which will cause the exhibits to become lifeless. Cecil explains that Ahkmenrah's parents, Merenkahre and Shepseheret, may be able to restore the tablet's power but that they are located in the British Museum. Larry convinces the museum's curator Dr. McPhee, who was fired due to the planetarium incident, to let him ship Ahkmenrah to London to restore the tablet, although McPhee is still under the impression that the magic is just clever special effects. Larry and Nick travel to the British Museum, bypassing the night guard Tilly. To Larry's surprise, some of the other American exhibits stowed away with Ahkmenrah: Theodore Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila the Hun, miniatures Jedediah and Octavius, Dexter the capuchin monkey, and Laaa. Larry convinces Laaa to stay behind and stand guard while the others search the museum, as he believes Laaa is an idiot who will just get in the way. As the others go through the museum, the tablet brings the British exhibits to life. The group is joined by a wax figure of Sir Lancelot, who helps them fight off aggressive museum exhibits like a Triceratops skeleton and a Xiangliu statue. Throughout their journey, the corrosion worsens, and the American exhibits begin to experience side effects such as stiffening limbs and memory reversion. Jedediah and Octavius fall through a ventilation shaft but are rescued from an erupting Pompeii model by Dexter. The group find Ahkmenrah's parents, learning the tablet's power can be regenerated by moonlight, since it is empowered through the magic of Khonsu. Lancelot steals the tablet, mistaking it for the Holy Grail, and prepares to leave for Camelot. Larry and Laaa are locked in the employee break room by Tilly, but they escape with the help of Attila. Laaa remains behind to distract Tilly, during which time they become attracted to each other. Lancelot crashes a performance of the musical Camelot, starring Hugh Jackman and Alice Eve as King Arthur and Queen Guinevere, and is stunned to realize that unlike the other exhibits, Lancelot and Camelot are not real. Larry and the others catch up and chase him to the theatre's roof, where the corrosion almost consumes the entire tablet. Teddy, Attila, Sacagawea, Jed, and Octavius mostly turn back into wax; Ahkmenrah starts decomposing back into a dead mummy; and Dexter dies, as he was a real taxidermied animal. Larry tells Lancelot that he needs to align the pieces of the tablet so the moonlight can fix it, otherwise Lancelot and all the other exhibits will die. Larry tells him that although Camelot might not be real, Lancelot really is due to the tablet's magic, and that he does really have a life that he can live. Lancelot finally understands and gives the tablet back, and Larry straightens the pieces. The moonlight restores the tablet's power and restores the exhibits to full health. As the American exhibits prepare to return home, they decide that Ahkmenrah and his tablet should stay at the London Museum with his parents, even though this means the New York exhibits will no longer come to life. Larry is upset, but they all inform him that they are at peace with their unanimous decision. Ahkmenrah thanks Larry for reuniting him with his family, and the American exhibits go home. Back in New York, Larry spends some final moments with his friends before the sun rises, and then he leaves the museum for the last time. Three years later, Larry now works as a school teacher, having taken the blame for the planetarium incident and giving McPhee his job back. Tilly becomes the new night guard of the British Museum and brings a traveling exhibit comes to New York in a collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History. In McPhee's office, Tilly hands the tablet to McPhee, showing him its power and allowing the exhibits to awaken again as they throw a huge party. From across the street, Larry quietly observes the celebration and smiles.

Release[edit] The film premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on December 11, 2014.[23] It was then released on December 19, 2014 in the United States.[24] Reception[edit] Box office[edit] Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb grossed $113.7 million in North America, and $249.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $363.2 million against a budget of $127 million.[2] In North America, early analysts were predicting a potential $25–$28 million opening.[25][26] In North America, the film was released on December 19, 2014 across 3,785 theaters.[27] It opened Friday, December 19, 2014 and earned $5.6 million on its opening day, placing at number three at the box office.[28] The film underperformed expectations during its opening weekend, earning $17.1 million, which was relatively lower than the openings of the original film ($30.4 million) and its sequel ($54.1 million).[29] The film debuted at number two at the box office behind The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies.[30] According to 20th Century Fox, the movie's audience was 51% male, with 54% of the audience under the age of 25. In CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave the film an average grade of "B+", on an A+ to F scale.[30] The film began its international rollout the same weekend as the North American premiere and earned $10.4 million from 27 markets in its opening weekend, debuting at #3 behind at the box office behind The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies and Penguins of Madagascar.[31][32][33][34] The film expanded to an additional 40 markets in its second week and grossed $31.2 million.[35] It topped the box office outside North America in its fourth weekend with a total gross of $46.2 million, primarily because of China, where it opened at #1 with $26 million.[36] The other highest opening figures were from Mexico ($5.85 million), Brazil ($3.1 million), Malaysia ($3.07 million), the UK ($3 million), Australia ($2.8 million), Germany ($2.1 million) and Singapore ($2 million).[35][31][37] For the weekend of January 16, 2015, the film grossed $17.8 million, which includes a $3.9 million debut in South Korea.[38] Critical response[edit] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 47% approval rating, based on 104 reviews, with an average score of 5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "While not without its moments, Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb is a less-than-inspired sendoff for the trilogy."[39] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 47 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[40] In CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.[30] Scott Foundas of Variety gave the film a positive review, praising the visual effects and calling the production values "topnotch", and admiring Guillermo Navarro's work. He added, "A most enjoyable capper to director Shawn Levy and producer Chris Columbus' cheerfully silly and sneakily smart family-entertainment juggernaut... offers little in the way of secrets of surprises, but should add much holiday cheer to Fox's box-office coffers."[41] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film three stars out of five and said, "The third part in what absolutely no one is calling the Night at the Museum 'trilogy' turns out to be a good-natured and entertainingly surreal panto fantasy."[42] Glenn Kenny awarded the film 2½ stars out of 4 praising the Indiana Jones themed-set while criticizing the performances of the cast and said, "As talent-packed as any Night at the Museum picture may be—in this third installment... —one doesn't come to a movie of this sort expecting anybody's best work. Or at least one certainly shouldn't, because it won't materialize."[43] Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying "The third installment, Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb may be the best, and even the generally wound-too-tight Ben Stiller – once again playing a bemused Museum of Natural History guard – is easy to tolerate."[44] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying "Where the previous films felt frenetic and forced, this outing feels breezier, more enjoyable and less contrived."[45] Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News gave the film three out of five stars, saying "There's a serenity to museum visits, especially if it's a place you know and love. Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb, amazingly, recaptures that feeling in big-studio franchise form."[46] Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic gave the film two out of five stars, saying "Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb is a rather lackluster affair, a cash grab that tries to aim a little higher but confuses sappy shortcuts with real emotion."[47] Joe McGovern of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B, saying "It's kind of fun, unembarrassingly, and not least of all because the people who made it look like they had a good time doing so."[48] Tom Long of The Detroit News gave the film a B, saying "There are some key elements that make this Night at the Museum sequel work better than its predecessor."[49] Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger gave the film two out of four stars, saying "The exhibits in this Night at the Museum may still come to life nightly. But their latest movie stays stubbornly inert."[50] Tom Russo of The Boston Globe gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying "Seeing Ben Stiller, the late Robin Williams, and their magically roused gang together again, this time in London, is initially all about indulgent, nostalgic smiles rather than new wows. But then comes the movie's exceptionally clever and fresh final act, which delivers genuine surprise along with many laughs."[51] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph gave the film three out of five stars, saying "The third Night at the Museum film starts strongly, with its heart in the past... It's an exciting opening, and perhaps too exciting for the film's own good. It's hard not to be disappointed when the plot moves back to the present and settles into the time-honoured formula of digitised creatures running riot and famous people in fancy dress doing shtick."[52] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review, saying "Despite relocating across the pond to the esteemed British Museum, the creaky Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb fails to capitalize on the comic potential provided by that change of venue."[53] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+, saying "Secret of the Tomb plays it as a source of corny jokes, pop-culture references, and father-son bonding moments. In other words, it's exactly the kind of film that shouldn't be expected to engage with its assorted bizarre subtexts – but what a movie it could be if it did."[54] Sara Stewart of the New York Post gave the film two out of four stars, saying "For piquing kids' interest in history and nature, you could do worse than this goofy Ben Stiller franchise. But its third installment is more meh than manic, too reliant on wide shots of the ragtag Museum of Natural History cohorts striding down corridors. You get the feeling returning director Shawn Levy is ready to hang it up."[55] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film one and a half stars out of five, saying "The dialogue is schmaltzy and often painfully unfunny. The special effects are often so 1980s-bad, one wonders if it was a deliberate choice, to make the creepy visuals of sculptures dancing and paintings moving less frightening to young viewers. Time and again, terrific actors sink in the equivalent of cinematic quicksand, helpless against the sucking sound of this movie."[56] Drew Hunt of Slant Magazine gave the film one out of four stars, saying "None of the entries in the Night at the Museum series could ever pass for high art, but a wealth of comedic talent gave the first two installments a madcap energy that somewhat forgave their childish premises. Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb, the third and supposedly final edition in the franchise, is nothing more than an uncomfortably transparent contractual obligation."[57] Future[edit] Animated sequel[edit] In August 2019, following the purchase of 21st Century Fox and its assets by Disney, The Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger announced that a reboot of Night at the Museum is in development. The project will release as a Disney+ exclusive film, as a co-production between Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures and 20th Century Studios.[58][59] In October 2020, the movie was officially titled Night at the Museum: Kahmunrah Rises Again. The project will be CGI-animated and is scheduled to be released in 2021.[60] The plot centers around Larry's son, Nick, who is hesitant to follow on his father's footsteps as nightwatchman.[60] In addition to Nick and the titular villain, the movie will also feature returning characters: Jedediah, Octavius, Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt (a new actor in place of Robin Williams); with the addition of Joan of Arc as well. Production began on November 2, 2020.[60] Spin-offs[edit] In August 2018, CEO of 20th Century Fox Stacey Snider announced that a television series based on Night at the Museum was in development.[61] Following the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, many of Fox's projects were shelved. In October 2020, The DisInsider announced that a live-action theatrical film is in the early stages of development.[60] Accolades[edit] Award Category Recipient(s) Result Ref(s) Teen Choice Awards Choice Movie: Comedy Nominated [62] Choice Movie Actor: Comedy Ben Stiller Nominated Kids' Choice Awards Favorite Movie Actor Ben Stiller Won [63][64] Home media[edit] Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb was released on Blu-ray and DVD on March 10, 2015.[65] The film debuted in second place on the home media charts behind The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1.[66] References[edit] ^ "NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM: SECRET OF THE TOMB (PG)".
