(June 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The Elias sisters, Moll and Lora, attempt to stop their vengeful sister, Belvera, from stealing the Elias triangle, three power units that can transform the sisters' daggers into powerful swords. Belvera succeeds, but is thwarted by her sisters' pet, Fairy Mothra, and fails to retrieve the proper unit for her dagger while Moll and Lora end up with one for the former. Shortly afterward, a meteor lands on Earth. The next day, preteen Shota ditches school to investigate as children from across the city mysteriously vanish. Moll and Lora examine the meteor's remains and realize a great evil has been released. King Ghidorah, a three-headed space dragon who visited Earth in its past and destroyed the dinosaurs, returns with the captured children inside an organic dome and brings them to a secluded spot. Mothra Leo arrives to battle Ghidorah, but the latter dominates the fight, forcing the former to escape. Moll and Lora encounter Ghidorah, who hypnotizes the latter and forces her to attack Moll while attempting to drag both into its dome until Fairy saves Moll. Intrigued by Ghidorah's arrival, Belvera investigates, but ends up in the dome. As the space dragon wreaks havoc, Moll encounters Shota, who learned his siblings Shuehei and Tamako were captured as well, and tells him about Ghidorah's plan to feed on the children's life force before convincing him to accompany her to see Leo. Communicating telepathically, Moll and Leo devise a plan. Once she gives him her remaining powers, Leo transforms into Light Speed Mothra so he can travel back in time and confront a weaker version of Ghidorah. However, he faces another losing battle. Meanwhile, Moll gives Shota her sword and asks him to let Ghidorah capture him so he can find Lora and convince her to help Leo. After Shota reluctantly agrees, a weakened Moll falls into a state of suspended animation. Inside the dome, a worried Belvera encounters Lora and tells her that Ghidorah plans to destroy Earth. Still under Ghidorah's spell, Lora takes Belvera's unit, transforms her dagger, and engages her sister in combat. Belvera begs Lora to see reason and work with her, but to no avail. Shota finds Lora, but she attacks him. Belvera tries to stop her while he tries to remind Lora of who she is. Ghidorah's spell breaks and Lora collapses while her sword combines with Moll's. Realizing the Elias triangle represents her and her sisters, Belvera uses the last unit to transform her dagger and combine her sword with Moll and Lora's in an attempt to break the dome while Lora recovers. As the dome shakes violently, Shota realizes Leo is losing and asks Lora to help him. With her powers, Leo recovers and immobilizes Ghidorah long enough to drop it into a volcano, which erupts and destroys it, though not before a severed piece of Ghidorah's tail burrows itself underground. Grievously injured by the battle, Leo crashes to the ground. However, three primitive Mothra larvae wrap him in a cocoon, where he spends the next 65 million years healing and metamorphosing. In the present, Ghidorah and the dome disappear, freeing the captives. Shota reunites with his siblings and join Belvera and Lora as they stand vigil over Moll, unsure of how to save her. Suddenly, a new Ghidorah emerges and recaptures the children, having regenerated from the severed tail. Soon after, Leo's cocoon explodes and he emerges as Armor Mothra. In the ensuing battle, Leo disintegrates Ghidorah before telling Belvera and Lora to channel their powers through their sword to revive Moll. The Elias do as they are told and succeed, though the sword vanishes and Belvera flies off. The children are released once more and reunite with their parents. Shota, Shuehei, Tamako, and their parents watch as the Elias, Fairy, and Leo, now Eternal Mothra, fly off into the sunset.
