Fire Temple of Kashmar[edit] Hi @HistoryofIran:, Please add this article to the template, Read the article, This fire temple has enough fame For template, Thank you POS78 (talk) 06:37, 5 February 2021 (UTC) No. How does it have enough fame for the template? It is not even nearly as important as the Adur Gushnasp, let alone the Avesta, Gathas, etc. Stop this cherry picking, stop trying to add this everywhere. --HistoryofIran (talk) 14:30, 5 February 2021 (UTC)
