Cast[edit] Rob Lowe as John Spencer Larisa Miller as Chloe Spencer Craig Wasson as Elgin Bates Harry Van Gorkum as Crowley Scott Anthony Viscomi as Nikos Gavras Reception[edit] Escape Under Pressure received very poor reviews from critics. Nate Yapp from Cinema Blend criticized every aspect of the film, from the script to the actor's performances, passing through "the worst CGI ever". Yapp concludes, stating: "Whatever happened to TV-movie pride (I know I'm digging deep here, folks). The medium used to be a way for up and coming directors to get some exposure (a la Steven Spielberg and John Carpenter). Now it seems to be an excuse to keep actors like Lowe and Corbin Bernsen in the public eye, if only for two hours".[1] In the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes the movie holds a 0% rating.[2] References[edit] ^ Yapp, Nate.
