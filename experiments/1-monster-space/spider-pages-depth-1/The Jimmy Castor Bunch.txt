He started a group called Jimmy and the Juniors, who recorded the original version of I Promise To Remember, which according to Castor[2] Mercury Records didn't want to promote.George Goldner had the famous doo-wop group The Teenagers record it and it became their third hit single. Later, Castor was asked to join the Teenagers.[3] In late 1966, he released "Hey Leroy, Your Mama's Callin' You". As a solo artist and leader of The Jimmy Castor Bunch (TJCB) in the 1970s, Castor released several successful albums and singles. TJCB hit their commercial peak in 1972 upon the release of their album, It's Just Begun, which featured two hit singles: the title track and "Troglodyte (Cave Man)", the latter of which became quite popular in the US, hitting #6 on the Billboard Hot 100. The track stayed on the chart for 14 weeks and on June 30, 1972, received a gold disc award from the RIAA for sales of a million copies.[1] Castor released "It's Just Begun" in 1972. In 1973, he recorded a soprano saxophone instrumental cover of "A Whiter Shade of Pale" written by Gary Brooker, Keith Reid and Matthew Fisher (from Procol Harum), on a tune inspired by J.S.Bach's Orchestral Suite No. 3 BWV1068 in his "Air on the G string”. Afrika Bambaataa said that "It's Just Begun" was very popular at South Bronx block parties in the 1970s. Later popular songs included "Bertha Butt Boogie", "Potential", "King Kong" and "A Groove Will Make You Move" in 1975 and 1976. The Jimmy Castor Bunch included keyboardist/trumpeter Gerry Thomas, bassist Doug Gibson, guitarist Harry Jensen, conga player Lenny Fridle, Jr., and drummer Bobby Manigault.[1] Thomas also recorded with the Fatback Band, leaving TJCB in the 1980s to exclusively record with them. Death[edit] He died of heart failure on January 16, 2012 in Henderson, Nevada, only a week short of his 72nd birthday.[4] Influence[edit] Many of the group's tunes have been heavily sampled in films and in hip-hop. In particular, the saxophone hook and groove from the title track of It's Just Begun. For example Ice-T sampled the track for the title track of his 1988 album Power.[5] Also, heavy sampled is the spoken word intro and groove from Troglodyte (Cave Man) (namely, "What we're gonna do right here is go back..." and "Gotta find a woman, gotta find a woman"). Industrial hip hop group Tackhead covered the song "Just Begun" for the digital release of their album For the Love of Money.[6] Family[edit] Castor's son, J-Cast named his name by choosing the letters of the father from Jimmy's "J" and Castor's "Cast". J-Cast released an album "J-CAST FOR PRESIDENT" in June 24, 2009 and it was popular in Japan especially.[7][8] J-Cast covered the father, Jimmy's song "It's Just Begun" as "IT'S JUST BEGUN...AGAIN" in the album. Also, the another song of the album "BABYGIRL JUST SAY I DO" was arranged by DJ KOMORI, a famous Japanese DJ as "BABYGIRL JUST SAY I DO (DJ KOMORI in 90s Remix)".
