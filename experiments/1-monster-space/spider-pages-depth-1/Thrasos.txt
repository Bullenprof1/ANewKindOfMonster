In Greek mythology, Thrasos[pronunciation?] (Greek Θράσος n.) is the personified concept of boldness. Although the word θράσος itself could be used both in the positive ("courage") and the negative ("over-boldness, insolence") senses,[1] in the only context where Thrasos appears as a personification (a daemon), it is definitely a malicious and suspicious being, mentioned together with Hybris and Atë and opposed to Dike.[2][3] References[edit] ^ A Greek-English Lexicon compiled by H.
