Contents 1 Dracula films 2 Carmilla films 3 Elizabeth Bathory films 4 Other vampire films 5 See also 6 Notes 7 External links Dracula films[edit] There have been numerous films based on Dracula, an 1897 Gothic horror novel by Irish author Bram Stoker. It introduced the character of Count Dracula, and established many conventions of subsequent vampire fantasy.[1] The novel tells the story of Dracula's attempt to move from Transylvania to England so that he may find new blood and spread the undead curse and of the battle between Dracula and a small group of men and a woman led by Professor Abraham Van Helsing. Some filmmakers have also combined fact with fiction and merged Stoker's Dracula with the real Vlad III Dracula, often called Vlad Tepes and Vlad the Impaler.

Carmilla films[edit] There have been numerous films based on Carmilla, an 1872 Gothic novella by Irish author Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu and one of the early works of vampire fiction, predating Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897) by 26 years. The story is narrated by a young woman preyed upon by a female vampire named Carmilla, later revealed to be Mircalla, Countess Karnstein (Carmilla is an anagram of Mircalla). The character is a prototypical example of the lesbian vampire, expressing romantic desires toward the protagonist.

Elizabeth Bathory films[edit] There have been a number of vampire films based on or inspired by Countess Elizabeth Báthory (1560-1614), a Hungarian noblewoman and reputed serial killer from the noble family of Báthory, who owned land in the Kingdom of Hungary (now Hungary, Slovakia and Romania). Stories describing her vampire-like tendencies (most famously, the tale that she bathed in the blood of virgins to retain her youth) were generally recorded years after her death and are considered unreliable. Her story quickly became part of national folklore and her infamy persists to this day. She is often compared to Vlad the Impaler of Wallachia (on whom the fictional Count Dracula is partly based); some insist that she inspired Bram Stoker's novel Dracula (1897),[5] though there is no evidence to support this hypothesis.[6] Nicknames and literary epithets attributed to her include The Blood Countess and Countess Dracula.
