The Balrog Awards were a set of awards given annually from 1979 to 1985 for the best works and achievements of speculative fiction in the previous year. The awards were named after the balrog, a fictional creature from J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium.[1] The awards were originally announced by editor Jonathan Bacon in Issue #15 of Fantasy Crossroads and presented at the Fool-Con II convention on April Fool's Day, 1979 at Johnson County Community College, Kansas.[2] The awards were never taken seriously and are often referred to, tongue-in-cheek, as the "coveted Balrog Awards".[1] Contents 1 Awards (By Year) 1.1 1979 1.2 1980 1.3 1981 1.4 1982 1.5 1983 1.6 1984 1.7 1985 2 See also 3 References Awards (By Year)[edit] 1979[edit] Best Novel: Blind Voices, Tom Reamy Best Short Fiction: "Death from Exposure", Pat Cadigan Best Collection/Anthology: Born to Exile, Phyllis Eisenstein Best Poet: Ray Bradbury Best Artist: Tim Kirk Best Amateur Publication: Shayol Best Professional Publication: Age of Dreams, Alicia Austin Best Amateur Achievement: Paul C.
