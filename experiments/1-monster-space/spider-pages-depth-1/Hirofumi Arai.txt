His next film role was the emotionally disturbed senior high school student Aoki in Toshiaki Toyoda's Blue Spring, which won him the Best New Actor award at the 17th Takasaki Film Festival.[3] In 2011, Arai co-starred as Detective Kazuhiko Soga in a one-off TV crime thriller Douki with co-stars Ryuhei Matsuda as Detective Ryota Udagawa and Chiaki Kuriyama as Michiru Soga. The June 2012 issue of Switch, a Japanese arts and media magazine,[4] features a special segment on top ten manga that teaches love and passion, chosen by Japanese actors, artists and musicians including Arai, who chose Bakuman while explaining: "You should up your girl power by learning how to behave like a heroine."[5] Arai was represented by Anore Inc., a talent agency founded in 1996 by actor Tadanobu Asano, Asano's father Yukihisa Sato[6] and Asano's musician brother Kujun Sato.[7] The talent agency terminated his contract shortly after his arrest on February 1, 2019.[8] Personal life[edit] Arai's birth name is Park Kyung-sik (박경식).[9] He had stated in a number of Japanese interviews that he has a continual interest in being involved with films that explore Korean-Japanese issues. Tokyograph announced in 2007 that Arai entered a "serious relationship" with singer Miu Sakamoto, the eldest daughter of noted musician Ryuichi Sakamoto and singer-songwriter Akiko Yano, after meeting during a television talk show in 2006.[10] On February 1, 2019, Arai was arrested for sexual assault of an outcall masseuse on July 1, 2018 by police in Japan.[8][11][12] He was later indicted on February 21, 2019.[8][13] On December 2, 2019, Arai was sentenced to five years in prison.[14] On November 17, 2020, it was reduced to four years in prison due to the actor paying a settlement of 3 million yen (about US$29,000) to the victim.[15] Filmography[edit] Film[edit] Year Title Other titles Director Notes 2001 Blue Spring Aoi haru Toshiaki Toyoda Based on Taiyō Matsumoto's manga, sets in a run-down all-boys school where violence and apathy rule the roost.
