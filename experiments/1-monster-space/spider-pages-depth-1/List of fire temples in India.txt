A fire temple, Agiary, Atashkadeh (Persian: آتشکده‎), Atashgah (آتشگاه) or Dar-e Mehr (در مهر) is the place of worship for the followers of Zoroastrianism, the ancient religion of Iran (Persia).[1][2][3] In the Zoroastrian religion, fire (see atar), together with clean water (see aban), are agents of ritual purity. Clean, white "ash for the purification ceremonies [is] regarded as the basis of ritual life", which "are essentially the rites proper to the tending of a domestic fire, for the temple [fire] is that of the hearth fire raised to a new solemnity".[4] For, one "who sacrifices unto fire with fuel in his hand ..., is given happiness".[5] There are about 177 odd fire temples in the world, of which some 150 are in India.[6] List of Fire temples in India[edit] Name Location Picture Notes Bahrot Caves near Dahanu Bahrot Caves, locally known as Barad, near Dahanu, Maharashtra are the only Parsi/Zoroastrian Cave temple in India. Bahrot Caves is located 25 km south of Sanjan, Gujarat and are situated at a small distance of 8 km away from the village of Bordi. They were unused Buddhist caves excavated by Buddhist monks. Zoroastrians hid for 13 years in these mountains after an invasion of their settlement at Sanjan by Alaf Khan, a general of Muhammad bin Tughluq in 1393 CE. The ‘Iranshah Flame’ was also moved to Bahrot during this period (1393–1405 CE). Even today, the Holy Fire is burning and it is given the most eminent grade of devoted fire in the world. Bahrot Caves have been declared a heritage site and is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).[7][8][9][10] Banaji Limji Agiary Mumbai Banaji Limji Agiary is the oldest Zoroastrian fire temple (or agiary, Gujarati for "house of fire") in Mumbai, India that was constructed in 1709.[11] The fire was consecrated here by the Parsi businessman Seth Banaji Limji.[12] The temple has a fortress-like structure and non-Parsis are not allowed to enter, as in all Zoroastrian temples.[13] The temple is a Grade II heritage structure.[14] Situated less than a kilometre away from the temple, Maneckji Seth Agiary (1733) is the second-oldest fire temple in Mumbai.
