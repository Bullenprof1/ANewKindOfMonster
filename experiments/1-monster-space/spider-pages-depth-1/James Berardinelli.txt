He worked during the next 15 years "in a variety of fields, including fiber optics, video testing, and software systems."[2] Berardinelli has categorized himself as an agnostic and a libertarian.[3] He resides in Mount Laurel, New Jersey with his wife, Sheryl, whom he met through his website.[3][5][6][7] They have two children: a son born in May 2010, and a daughter born in November 2019.[8][9] Career[edit] Starting in January 1992, Berardinelli began writing movie reviews, his first being a review of the 1991 drama Grand Canyon.[10] His first review published to the Internet was of the 1992 drama Scent of a Woman, which was posted both to Usenet and his Colossus Inc-hosted[11] website, ReelViews[12], hosted at movie-reviews.colossus.net. Roger Ebert referred to Berardinelli as "the best of the Web-based critics" in 2001,[13] and wrote a foreword for the 2003 book, Reelviews, a collection of Berardinelli's reviews.[14] Berardinelli is a member of the Broadcast Film Critics Association and is a Rotten Tomatoes-approved critic.[15][16] In January 2004,[17] he began his blog ReelThoughts, by which time his reviews could attract as many as 100,000 readers,[18] up from around 1,400 weekly readers in 1997.[19] In August 2006,[20] the site moved to ReelViews.net, a domain Berardinelli had originally registered by late 2000[21]. In September 2013, Berardinelli announced that he had been working on a trilogy of fantasy novels entitled The Last Whisper of the Gods.[22] The first book was published in November 2015, the second was released in January 2016, and the third in March 2016.[23] Berardinelli appears as a guest on the pop-culture radio program Fictional Frontiers every two weeks.[24] Annual film rankings[edit] 1993: Schindler's List 1994: Pulp Fiction 1995: Cry, The Beloved Country 1996: Hamlet 1997: The Sweet Hereafter 1998: Saving Private Ryan 1999: The War Zone 1990s overall: Schindler's List 2000: Requiem for a Dream 2001: Memento 2002: Minority Report 2003: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King 2004: Maria Full of Grace 2005: Munich 2006: The Departed 2007: The Lives of Others 2008: The Dark Knight 2009: Avatar 2000s: overall: The Lord of the Rings 2010: The King's Speech 2011: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo 2012: Looper 2013: Before Midnight 2014: Interstellar 2015: The Hateful Eight 2016: Arrival 2017: Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri 2018: Shoplifters 2019: Once Upon a Time in Hollywood 2010s overall: Before Midnight 2020: Tenet Bibliography[edit] Berardinelli, James (2003) ReelViews : The Ultimate Guide to the Best 1,000 Modern Movies on DVD and Video, ISBN 1-932112-06-5 Berardinelli, James (2005) ReelViews 2: The Ultimate Guide to the Best 1,000 Modern Movies on DVD and Video, 2005 Edition, ISBN 1-932112-40-5 Berardinelli, James (2015) The Last Whisper of the Gods, ASIN B-016IWS-UN-M Berardinelli, James (2016) The Curse of the Gift, ASIN B-019CPR-EH-K Berardinelli, James (2016) The Shadow of the Otherverse, ASIN B-01BRSW-VH-S Berardinelli, James (2017) The Lingering Haze, ISBN 1-520762-02-X References[edit] ^ Berardinelli, James (August 3, 2009).
