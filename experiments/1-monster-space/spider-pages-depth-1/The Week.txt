The final edition, its 199th, was released on 12 October 2012. At the end, it was selling 28,000 copies a week, with a readership of 83,000.[7] Content[edit] The various editions of the magazine provide perspectives on the week's current events and other news, as well as editorial commentary from global media, with the intent to provide readers with multiple political viewpoints.
