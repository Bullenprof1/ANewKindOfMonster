The first editors were Mr. John and Mrs. Johnstone until 1824. Mrs. Christian Isobel Johnstone produced the widely acclaimed Meg Dod’s Cookery Book.[4][5] Dr. Robert Carruthers[6] was editor from April 1828 till his death in 1878,[7] when his son Walter Carruthers took over until his death in 1885. He was succeeded by James Barron. Walter Carruthers and James Barron were co-founders of Inverness Field Club in 1875. In Feb. 1919, Dr. Evan Macleod Barron became editor, who was the author of The Scottish War of Independence. His niece Eveline Barron became deputy editor in 1952, succeeding him as editor in April 1965.[8][9] The current editor is David Bourn.[10] The Rev. Alexander Stewart (1829–1901), Minister of Ballachulish & Corran of Ardgour Parish contributed for more than four decades, under the pen-name Nether Lochaber, a more-or-less fortnightly column to the Inverness Courier. This resulted in two publications: Nether Lochaber: The Natural History, Legends and Folk-lore of the West Highlands (1883) and 'Twixt Ben Nevis and Glencoe: The Natural History, Legends, and Folk-lore of the West Highlands (1885). In May 1933, The Inverness Courier published the first report of the Loch Ness monster.[11] A Courier correspondent, Alexander Campbell, had told of the strange sighting to then editor Evan Barron, who is said to have replied that it must be a monster.[8] Today[edit] The Inverness Courier is published by Scottish Provincial Press,[12] which publishes several weekly newspapers in the Highland council area of Scotland. In 2014, The Inverness Courier was named the Highlands and Islands newspaper of the year. Due to a massive drop in circulation, this newspaper has had to move from its Longman  headquarters, downsize and relocate to  offices in Bank Street, Inverness.
