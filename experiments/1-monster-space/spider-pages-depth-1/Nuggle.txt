A nuggle, njuggle, or neugle, is a mythical water horse of primarily Shetland folklore where it is also referred to as a shoepultie or shoopiltee on some parts of the islands. A nocturnal creature that is always of a male gender, there are occasional fleeting mentions of him connected with the Orkney islands but he is more frequently associated with the rivers, streams and lochs of Shetland. He is easily recognised by his distinctive wheel-like tail and, unlike his evil counterparts the each-uisge or the nuckelavee, has a fairly gentle disposition being more prone to playing pranks and making mischief rather than having malicious intents.

he also records shoupiltin but merely catalogues it as a triton from Shetland.[7] Folk beliefs[edit] Description and common attributes[edit] Nuggles were water spirits that inhabited the rivers, streams and small lochs of the Shetland islands;[8] they were known as the shoopiltee[8] or the shoepultie in some areas of Shetland[9] particularly in the northernmost islands.[10] Karl Blind, a 19th-century folklorist who regularly wrote about the lore of Shetland,[11] asserts that after extensive enquiries he had only ever heard of the nuggle being in Shetland;[12] there may however be tentative references to it around the lochs and watercourses of Hoy[13] and at Muckle Water on Rousay which are both part of the Orkney archipelago.[14] Tales of nuggles were never recorded on the islands of Yell and Fetlar, parts of the Shetland archipelago.[15] The creatures were also found beside watermills[16] and never strayed very far from water.[12] The entity was capable of assuming many disguises but generally favoured the form of an attractive horse;[8] he never assumed a human form.[17] Nuggles were always male water horses or ponies and were never portrayed as mares.[12] His overall proportions were like those of a generously fed and well-conditioned Shetland pony or horse.[10] The colour of his sleek coat ranged from a deep bluish-grey[18] through to a very light, almost white, grey.[10] Similar equine type creatures are: the evil Each-uisge from the Gaelic folklore of the Scottish Highlands;[19] the Tangies that haunt the coastline and sea shores but reside in the ocean depths;[20] and the Norwegian nøkk.[8] Folklorist Ernest Marwick considers the demonic Nuckelavee, which features in Orcadian folk tales, to also be a relative of the nuggle.[8] Among the characteristics distinguishing the nuggle from his counterparts was his tail which resembled a wheel.[8] The trademark tail made him easily recognisable[21] despite his attempts to hide it between his hind legs[8] so he tended to stay out of sight except at night or just as the sun went down in the twilight hours.[21] Additionally, unlike other corresponding creatures, he was of a gentle disposition, more likely to instil fear rather than attacking islanders although some tales suggest otherwise;[21] according to the author and folklorist Jessie Saxby "he was a more feeble sort".[20] He liked playing practical jokes and making mischief[21] but was deceitful and not very brave.[12] Spitefulness was not a part of his character and his pranks were tempered with a degree of mercy.[9] Only magical beings called Finns[a] were able to ride a nuggle without coming to any harm.[23] If the nuggle had successfully tricked an unsuspecting passer-by into mounting him, usually by pretending to be tame and standing tranquilly at the side of a path, he would immediately make for the nearest deep water.[21] Origins[edit] Saxby suggests fear of the nuggle prevented children venturing too close to deep water or watermills and that parents embellished the tale by adding the creature was capable of producing a pleasant tune providing a child stood well away from the water.[16] John Spence, a resident of Lerwick and author of the 1899 publication Shetland Folk-lore,[24] agrees many of the legendary tales of spirits were told as a precaution to keep children out of danger; he further explains the tales originated in bygone times when oral traditions were passed down the generations by grandparents retelling the stories.[25] Writing in the Journal of American Folklore during 1918 the anthropologist James Teit hypothesises that, as is common with most supernatural creatures, nuggles were thought to be fallen angels.[26] References[edit] Notes[edit] ^ Finns in Shetland lore were distinct from the Finfolk of Orkney described by Walter Traill Dennison;[22] Finns later coalesced with supernatural marine entities, as which they are better known.[3] Citations[edit] ^ Barnes (1984), p. 352 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFBarnes1984 (help) ^ Barnes (1984), p. 355 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFBarnes1984 (help) ^ a b c Dr. Andrew Jennings (2010), "The Finnfolk", University of the Highlands and Islands, archived from the original on 23 October 2014, retrieved 13 June 2016 ^ Briggs (2002), p. 108 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFBriggs2002 (help) ^ "neugle, n", Dictionary of the Scots Language (online ed.), retrieved 13 June 2016 ^ "shoupiltin, n", Dictionary of the Scots Language (online ed.), retrieved 13 June 2016 ^ Edmondston (1866), pp. 77, 101 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFEdmondston1866 (help) ^ a b c d e f g Marwick (2000), p. 23 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFMarwick2000 (help) ^ a b Blind (1881), p. 191 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFBlind1881 (help) ^ a b c Teit (1918), p. 183 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFTeit1918 (help) ^ Abrams (2005), p. 35 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFAbrams2005 (help) ^ a b c d Blind (1881), p. 189 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFBlind1881 (help) ^ "The Nuggle", Orkneyjar, archived from the original on 22 June 2016, retrieved 22 June 2016 ^ "Fishing and watersports", Discover Rousay, archived from the original on 22 June 2016, retrieved 22 June 2016 ^ Bruford (1997), p. 131 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFBruford1997 (help) ^ a b Saxby (1932), p. 141 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFSaxby1932 (help) ^ Bruford (1997), p. 123 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFBruford1997 (help) ^ Angus (1914), p. 96 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFAngus1914 (help) ^ MacKillop, James (2004), "each uisce, each uisge, aughisky", A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology (online ed.), Oxford University Press, retrieved 13 June 2016 ^ a b Saxby (1932), p. 140 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFSaxby1932 (help) ^ a b c d e Teit (1918), p. 184 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFTeit1918 (help) ^ Marwick (2000), p. 25 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFMarwick2000 (help) ^ Spence (1899), p. 23 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFSpence1899 (help) ^ Peacock (1900), p. 316 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFPeacock1900 (help) ^ Spence (1899), pp. 7-8 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFSpence1899 (help) ^ Teit (1918), p. 186 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFTeit1918 (help) Bibliography[edit] Abrams, Lynn (2005), Myth and Materiality in a Woman's World: Shetland 1800-2000, Manchester University Press, ISBN 978-0-7190-6592-7 Angus, James Stout (1914), A Glossary of the Shetland Dialect, Alexander Gardner Barnes, Michael P.
