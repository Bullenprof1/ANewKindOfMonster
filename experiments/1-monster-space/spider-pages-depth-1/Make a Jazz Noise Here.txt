It was first released in June 1991, and was the third Zappa album to be compiled from recordings from his 1988 world tour, following Broadway the Hard Way (1988) and The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life (1991). The album's cover art was made by Larry Grossman. Contents 1 Album content 2 Track listing 3 Personnel 4 References 5 External links Album content[edit] The album consists largely of instrumentals. Besides many of Zappa's own compositions, there are also some arrangements of Igor Stravinsky and Béla Bartók themes by his bassist, Scott Thunes. The album showcases Mike Keneally on guitar and keyboards. The drummer is Chad Wackerman, a highly regarded musician in the jazz world (he has frequently played with jazz guitarist Allan Holdsworth). A notable contribution to the mix is made by the brass section of the group: Walt Fowler (trumpet), Bruce Fowler (trombone), and saxophonists Paul Carman, Albert Wing and Kurt McGettrick. Ike Willis plays guitar and sings, along with keyboardist Bobby Martin. Ed Mann provides all the percussion and various other sounds, complementing the addition of the Synclavier, which Zappa brought on tour for the first and only time (In the midst of the 1988 tour, Zappa fired the bulk of his band and cancelled the remaining tour primarily due to infighting between specific band members). In the liner notes, Zappa states that the album features no overdubs. Track listing[edit] All tracks written by Frank Zappa, except where noted.
