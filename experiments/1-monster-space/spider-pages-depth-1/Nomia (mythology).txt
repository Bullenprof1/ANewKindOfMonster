Nomia is also a possible name for the Sicilian nymph who loved Daphnis but was abandoned by him and, in revenge, blinded the young man and changed him into a rock.[3] Notes[edit] ^ Pausanias, Description of Greece, 8. 38. 11 ^ Pausanias, Description of Greece, 10. 31. 10 ^ Servius on Virgil's Eclogue 8. 68 References[edit] Pausanias, Description of Greece with an English Translation by W.H.S.
