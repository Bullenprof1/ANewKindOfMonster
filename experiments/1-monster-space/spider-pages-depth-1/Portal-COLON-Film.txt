Portal topics Activities Culture Geography Health History Mathematics Nature People Philosophy Religion Society Technology Random portal Introduction In computing, an application programming interface (API) is an interface that defines interactions between multiple software applications or mixed hardware-software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees. An API can be entirely custom, specific to a component, or designed based on an industry-standard to ensure interoperability. Through information hiding, APIs enable modular programming, allowing users to use the interface independently of the implementation. Reference to Web APIs is currently the most common use of the term. There are also APIs for programming languages, software libraries, computer operating systems, and computer hardware.
