She was the sister of Tylus. Mythology[edit] Moria makes an appearance in Nonnus' Dionysiaca, in an episode that is as follows. Tylus accidentally touched a serpent, which then attacked Tylus, coiled round his body and suffocated him; Tylus was not his first victim. Moria only could helplessly watch her brother die, but then Damasen, a Giant son of Gaia, arrived on the spot; Moria implored him to help and he killed the serpent, hitting it with the trunk of a tree he tore out of the ground. Then a female serpent, the slain monster's mate, appeared and used a magical herb, referred to as "Zeus' flower", to bring the dead serpent back to life. Moria then used the same herb to revive her brother.[1] It has been speculated that the myth of Moria, Tylus and Damasen may be rooted in Lydian mythology.[2] A similar story could be compared to that of Polyidus who used an herb to resurrect Glaucus, the son of Minos.[3] References[edit] ^ Nonnus, Dionysiaca, 25. 452 ff ^ Theoi.com - Moria (accessed on April 13, 2012) ^ Apollodorus, Library 3.3.1.
