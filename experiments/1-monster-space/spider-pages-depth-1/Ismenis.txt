In Statius' Thebaid, Ismenis was the mother, by Pan, of Crenaeus, a defender of Thebes in the war of the Seven against Thebes. When Crenaeus was killed by Hippomedon whom he had challenged to single combat, Ismenis searched for his body which was carried away by the flow of River Ismenus, and, upon finding it, lamented her son's fate.[1] Note[edit] ^ Statius, Thebaid, 9. 318 - 403 References[edit] Publius Papinius Statius, The Thebaid translated by John Henry Mozley.
