G[edit] Geoffrey, Justin[edit] An English poet, who died in a lunatic asylum. Some years before, his already frail psyche had been warped by looking too much at the Black Stone of legend near the village of Stregoicvar. He never witnessed the annual, nocturnal rite of 24 June. The narrator in "The Black Stone" mentions that if he had, he would have become insane much earlier. His poetry is used as prelude in The Thing on the Roof. and his backstory was explored in the unfinished story, The House.
