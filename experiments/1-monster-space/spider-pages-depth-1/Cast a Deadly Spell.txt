Philip Lovecraft, in a fictional Los Angeles where magic is real, monsters and mythical beasts stalk the back alleys, zombies are used as cheap labor, and everyone — except Lovecraft — uses magic every day. Yet cars, telephones and other modern technology coexist with magic in this world. Lovecraft is hired by wealthy Amos Hackshaw to find Hackshaw's former chauffeur, Larry Willis, who has stolen a mysterious grimoire called the Necronomicon and recover the missing book within forty-eight hours. However, what seems like a simple "forty bucks a day and expenses" case turns out to be not so simple. Things take a chilling turn as he finds himself embroiled in a plot involving magical hitmen, pure damsels, old flames and enemies, and ancient evils, all connected by the Necronomicon, and possibly leading to the destruction of the world. Critical reception[edit] In The New York Times John J. O'Connor said, "... Cast a Deadly Spell, a new HBO Pictures production that can be seen tonight at 8 on the pay-cable service, gives the city a spin that should make even its most jaded observers sit up, chuckle and wince.... Mining familiar formulas, Mr. Dougherty's Cast a Deadly Spell is engagingly different and special."[1] In the Chicago Tribune Rick Kogan said, "I've had some very strange times in Los Angeles, spotted some very strange people. But none of what I've done or seen in that town can compare with what happens to H. Phillip Lovecraft in a special effects-filled and wildly successful original Home Box Office movie called Cast a Deadly Spell... Casting its own spell, this movie invigorates."[2] Sequel[edit] HBO produced a sequel, Witch Hunt with Dennis Hopper playing Lovecraft in place of Ward. Witch Hunt takes place in the 1950s during the Second Red Scare, with magic substituted for communism. Many characters reappear from Cast a Deadly Spell, although some have different backstories.
