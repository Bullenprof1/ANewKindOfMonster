It was composed by Brian Tyler and released on December 11, 2007, by Varèse Sarabande.[2][3] The score is completely orchestral and incorporates several themes from both the Alien and Predator franchises. Contents 1 Background 2 Track listing 3 Selected credits 4 References Background[edit] The film's main theme track is a clash of two main themes, one consisting of the Predator type theme (bongos and basses) and the second of the Aliens (high pitched violins, violas and flutes). The directors Greg and Colin Strause wanted to take a new direction from Harald Kloser's Alien vs. Predator score and wanted Tyler to use some reference to the three films' original score pieces, such as the horrific violas and percussion from James Horner's Aliens and the primitive tribal percussion from Alan Silvestri's Predator and Predator 2.[4] Tyler also referenced composer John Frizzel's Alien: Resurrection into the score, in the tracks of "National Guard" and "Taking Sides".
