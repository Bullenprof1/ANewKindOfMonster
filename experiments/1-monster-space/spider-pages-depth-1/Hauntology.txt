This article is about the philosophical concept. For its application in music, see Hauntology (music). Phenomenological state Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, Act I, Scene IV by Henry Fuseli (1789) Hauntology (a portmanteau of haunting and ontology[1]) is a concept referring to the return or persistence of elements from the past, as in the manner of a ghost. It is a neologism first introduced by French philosopher Jacques Derrida in his 1993 book Spectres of Marx. It has since been invoked in fields such as visual arts, philosophy, electronic music, politics, fiction and literary criticism.[2] Derrida used the term to refer to the atemporal nature of Marxism and its tendency to "haunt Western society from beyond the grave."[3] It describes a situation of temporal and ontological disjunction in which presence is replaced by a deferred non-origin.[2] The concept is derived from his deconstructive method, in which any attempt to locate the origin of identity or history must inevitably find itself dependent on an always-already existing set of linguistic conditions.[4] Despite being the central focus of Spectres of Marx, the word hauntology appears only three times in the book, and there is little consistency in how other writers define the term.[5] In the 2000s, the term was applied to musicians who were said to explore ideas related to temporal disjunction, retrofuturism, cultural memory, and the persistence of the past.

Derrida calls on Shakespeare's Hamlet, particularly a phrase spoken by the titular character: "the time is out of joint".[4] The word functions as a deliberate near-homophone to "ontology" in Derrida's native French (cf. "Hantologie", [ɑ̃tɔlɔʒi] and "ontologie", [ɔ̃tɔlɔʒi]).[6] Derrida's prior work in deconstruction, on concepts of trace and différance in particular, serves as the foundation of his formulation of hauntology,[2] fundamentally asserting that there is no temporal point of pure origin but only an "always-already absent present".[7] His writing in Spectres is marked by a preoccupation with the "death" of communism after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, in particular after theorists such as Francis Fukuyama asserted that capitalism had conclusively triumphed over other political-economic systems and reached the "end of history".[4] Despite being the central focus of Spectres of Marx, the word hauntology appears only three times in the book.[5] Peter Buse and Andrew Scott, discussing Derrida's notion of hauntology, explain: Ghosts arrive from the past and appear in the present. However, the ghost cannot be properly said to belong to the past.... Does then the 'historical' person who is identified with the ghost properly belong to the present? Surely not, as the idea of a return from death fractures all traditional conceptions of temporality. The temporality to which the ghost is subject is therefore paradoxical, at once they 'return' and make their apparitional debut [...] any attempt to isolate the origin of language will find its inaugural moment already dependent upon a system of linguistic differences that have been installed prior to the 'originary' moment (11).[4] Other usages[edit] See also: Hauntology (music) The Gernsback Continuum by William Gibson is exemplary of how early 20th century science fiction tropes haunts the imagination with e.g. Raygun Gothic architecture.[8] Hauntology has been used as a critical lens in various forms of media and theory, including music, political theory, architecture, Afrofuturism, anthropology, and psychoanalysis.[2][failed verification][9][page needed] Due to the difficulty in understanding the concept, there is little consistency in how other writers define the term.[5] In the 2000s, the term was taken up by critics in reference to paradoxes found in postmodernity, particularly contemporary culture's persistent recycling of retro aesthetics and incapacity to escape old social forms.[4] Writers such as Mark Fisher and Simon Reynolds used the term to describe a musical aesthetic preoccupied with this temporal disjunction and the nostalgia for "lost futures".[3] So-called "hauntological" musicians are described as exploring ideas related to temporal disjunction, retrofuturism, cultural memory, and the persistence of the past.[10][11][4] See also[edit] Deconstruction References[edit] ^ Original French: hantologie from hanter "haunting" and ontologie "ontology" ^ a b c d Gallix, Andrew (17 June 2011).
