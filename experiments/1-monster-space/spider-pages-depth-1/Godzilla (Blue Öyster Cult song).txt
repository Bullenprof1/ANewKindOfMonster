Buck Dharma Producer(s) Murray Krugman Sandy Pearlman David Lucas Blue Öyster Cult singles chronology "Goin' Through the Motions" (1977) "Godzilla" (1977) "We Gotta Get out of This Place" (1978) "Godzilla" is a single by American hard rock band Blue Öyster Cult, the first track from the band's fifth studio album Spectres. The lyrics are a tongue-in-cheek tribute to the popular movie monster of the same name. Despite failing to chart, the song received significant airplay on rock radio stations[4] and would go on to become a sleeper hit. The song is, along with "(Don't Fear) The Reaper" and "Burnin' for You", one of the band's best-known songs and has become a staple of its live performances. It has been covered by bands such as moe., Racer X, Fu Manchu, The Smashing Pumpkins, Sebastian Bach, Double Experience and Fighting Gravity.[5] In 2019, a cover of the song, sung by Serj Tankian, was featured in Godzilla: King of the Monsters, marking the first usage of the song in a Godzilla film. Parodies[edit] In response to the song's absence from the 1998 Godzilla soundtrack, Blue Öyster Cult members Eric Bloom and Buck Dharma created their own parody called "NoZilla",[6] released only to radio stations.
