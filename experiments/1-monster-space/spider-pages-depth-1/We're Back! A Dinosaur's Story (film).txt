A Dinosaur's Story is a 1993 American animated film based on the 1987 Hudson Talbott children's book of the same name and released to theaters on November 24, 1993. It depicts four intelligent anthropomorphized dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus Rex, Triceratops Woog, Pteranodon Elsa, and Parasaurolophus Dweeb, in their journey to the Museum of Natural History. The prehistoric beings have gone to the present time and become intelligent through eating a "Brain Grain" cereal invented by scientist Captain Neweyes, who wants dinosaurs to be personally seen by children. They face two major conflicts: an attempt to not be noticed by the public, and to not be exploited by Neweyes' evil brother Professor Screweyes, who wants to use the dinosaurs for his circus business. The dinosaurs are helped along by two runaway children, Louie and Cecilia. Produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblimation animation studio and distributed by Universal Pictures, We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story was directed by Dick Zondag, Ralph Zondag, Phil Nibbelink, and Simon Wells from a screenplay by John Patrick Shanley. Universal bought the rights to the novel only months after its publication, and Amblimation began storyboarding the adaptation in 1990 during the production of An American Tail: Fievel Goes West (1991). The film features the voices of John Goodman, Rene LeVant, Felicity Kendal, Charles Fleischer, Walter Cronkite, Jay Leno, Joey Shea, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short, Blaze Berdahl, and Rhea Perlman. We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story was released during a surge of the dinosaur in pop culture, known as the dinosaur renaissance; it was released the same year as another Spielberg dinosaur flick, Jurassic Park, and was marketed as the more family-friendly equivalent. Despite the dinosaur mania, it did not perform well at the box office, grossing $9.3 million. It received mixed reviews from critics; while its voice cast and animation were praised, most criticisms targeted the writing, particularly its convoluted-ness, pacing, unoriginality, and lack of character development.

Scientist Captain Neweyes wants children of the present time to see real dinosaurs, a species from a prehistoric era. He invents the "Brain Grain" cereal to anthropomorphize them and increase their intelligence, and hires the alien Vorb to go back in time to capture dinosaurs, give them the cereal, and send them to the present time. The dinosaurs Neweyes has garnered include Rex, a blue Triceratops named Woog, a purple Pteranodon named Elsa, and a green Parasaurolophus named Dweeb. Neweyes plans to take them to Dr. Julia Bleeb who will guide them to the Museum of Natural History and warns them to keep away from Professor Screweyes, his nefarious and evil brother who travels around causing mischief after losing his left eye several years ago. Neweyes drops the dinosaurs off in the Hudson River in the year 1993 AD, but they are unable to meet with Dr. Bleeb. They encounter two children willing to help, a boy named Louie who is running away to join the circus, and a girl named Cecilia. To avoid being noticed as real dinosaurs, they disguise themselves as floats in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The illusion falls apart, however, as a result of Rex accidentally deflating an Apatosaurus balloon. The citizens panic and the dinosaurs flee to Central Park while being pursued by the police and the army. Meanwhile, Louie and Cecilia meet Professor Screweyes, who is running the horror-themed "Eccentric Circus". Unaware of Screweyes' sinister nature, the children sign a contract to perform in his troupe. Screweyes plans to use the dinosaurs due to their scare potential. When the dinosaurs arrive to save the kids, Screweyes devolves Louie and Cecilia into chimpanzees using his "Brain Drain", pills that are the polar opposite of the Brain Grain. The dinosaurs reluctantly consume the pills for Screweyes to turn the two kids back into humans and release them. The next morning, a clown named Stubbs, who works for Professor Screweyes, informs the two kids about Screweyes' plan. That night, the kids sneak into the circus, where the dinosaurs perform their terrifying act. It involves Screweyes hypnotizing Rex before the trick is hindered by the accidental activation of flare lights. Rex initially goes after Screweyes, but Louie steps in and talks the tyrannosaurus out of his vengeance. His and Cecilia's impassioned pleas and loving touches return Rex and the other dinosaurs to their graces. Stubbs resigns from Professor Screweyes' employ, and Captain Neweyes arrives on a ship to ride Neweyes, Louie, Cecilia, and the dinosaurs out of the circus, leaving Screweyes to be devoured by crows. The dinosaurs spend the rest of their lives in the museum, fulfilling Neweyes' plan. In their later years, Louie and Cecilia reconcile with their respective parents and become a couple.

He was the most involved of the four directors on We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story. Hanna-Barbera was the first company to contact Hudson Talbott about obtaining rights to his book We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (1987), and the encounter occurred only months after its release; Universal Pictures then paid off Hanna-Barbera and purchased the rights for Spielberg to produce the film through his studio Amblimation.[4] Although Talbott had little involvement, he had many encounters with the creators of the film during production, including Spielberg who would make several calls to the author from Los Angeles and had a personal meeting with him when he first arrived in London.[4] We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story was directed by Simon Wells, Phil Nibbelink, and the brothers Ralph and Phil Zondag.[4] Wells was the least involved of them, and Nibbelink did most of the work; Wells only directed during writing before leaving the project to work on Balto (1995).[4] All of the directors constantly went in and out of We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story to work on a failed animated adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cat, which started and stalled several times.[4] Storyboarding of We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story began in 1990 during the production of An American Tail: Fievel Goes West (1991).[4] The first screenplay draft was written by Flint Dille and Wells and was not well-received by Spielberg.[4] John Patrick Shanley, who had just won an Academy Award for his work on Moonstruck (1987), was hired by Spielberg to write another draft, which was done quickly and the one ultimately used.[4] Shanley made the previous draft darker, which Spielberg liked but Nibbelink disagreed with.[4] The book was only 20 pages and lacked any antagonist or sense of a plot, making it difficult to convert to a full-length feature; Talbott was often skeptical about how the book was being adapted, so another one of the directors, making Nibbelink instructing the author to have a positive mindset.[4] Talbott felt Shanley's script had none of the tongue-in-cheek humor that he wrote in his book.[4] Near the end of production, $1 million worth of alterations were made following a poor test screening at Universal.[4] One of them included the addition of the Macy's parade scene, which includes a song originally written for the film by Thomas Dolby, "Roll Back the Rock"; Little Richard sings it in the end credits.[4] Director Phil Nibbelink voiced the characters in animatics, which involved successful imitations of notable figures like Walter Cronkite and Julia Child; Spielberg, enjoying Nibbelink's voicing, cast the people that were impersonated in the animatics.[4] John Goodman started recording his voices shortly after having his wisdom teeth removed, and healed his face between takes.[4] We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story was not Wells' first encounter with Felicity Kendal, as he previously asked to work with her on a student project that she declined.[4] Three actors recorded for Professor Screweyes. The first was John Malkovich, which was rejected as Spielberg found his performance too dark, then Christopher Lloyd, which Spielberg also did not approve of. Spielberg finally went with Kenneth Mars for his pliability with voicing the character.[4] The voice actors and Nibbelink found Shanley's dialogue a bit unnatural, so they changed a few lines while recording; however, this was not approved by Shanley, so recordings of his original dialogue were in the final film.[4] Release and promotion[edit] Steven Spielberg in 2011. Two dinosaur films produced by him were released in 1993: Jurassic Park and the more family-friendly We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story. We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story was meant to capitalize on a craze of dinosaurs in popular culture[5][6][7] known as the dinosaur renaissance, which started in the 1960s.[8]:24 The mania include an explosion of animated dinosaur content attributed to the success of another dinosaur flick released by Spielberg, Jurassic Park (1993), which also included Cadillacs and Dinosaurs (1993–94), Godzilla: The Series (1998–2000), and Extreme Dinosaurs (1997).[9]:30 We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story was released the same year as Jurassic Park, and was marketed as the more family-friendly Spielberg-made dinosaur film; the tagline in promotional materials was "A dinosaur adventure for the whole family".[4] Fiction in the dinosaur renaissance presented the creatures in a more friendly and upfront manner, and We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story is an example as it depicts dinosaurs in an American suburb doing activities like playing golf.[8]:14, 24 We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story was heavily advertised and promoted with merchandise and fast food tie-ins.[10] A balloon of Rex floated at the real-life 1993 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, which deflated after coming into contact with a traffic light.[11] Hi-Tech Expressions also published platform video games based on the film for the Sega Genesis. Game Boy and Super Nintendo Entertainment System. In the Genesis and SNES games, the player plays as Cecilia and Louie helping the dinosaurs get to the museum;[12][13] while the Game Boy title involves the dinosaur Rex as a playable character rescuing the other three dinosaurs captured by Screweyes.[14] Universal Pictures released We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story to American theaters on November 24, 1993.[15]:212–213[16] It was released on home video on March 15, 1994. It was the first home release to use clamshell packaging. Each copy included pockets of reusable stickers and coupons for Universal Theme Parks and products from Nestle, The Hertz Corporation, and First Alert.[17] Reception[edit] Box office[edit] In the United States, We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story opened during the Thanksgiving holiday with other new entries including Mrs. Doubtfire, A Perfect World, and another family film that was a film adaptation of The Nutcracker.[18] It grossed $3.7 million on its opening weekend;[19] due to bad weather across the country, the weekend was generally uneventful for films and had an overall gross of $105 million, 20–25% less than the 1992 Thanksgiving weekend gross of $135 million.[20] In its second weekend, We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story grossed $1.5 million, a 60% decline.[21][22] Its run ended with a total gross of $9.3 million.[23] The film was generally considered by journalists to be a poor performer,[24] and it was the highest-grossing children's film of its opening weekend only because it was a generally poor weekend for the genre (Josh and S.A.M. grossed $800,000 while The Nutcracker made a lower amount).[19] Journalists called the commercial performance of the film an indicator of how difficult it was to compete with Walt Disney Animation Studios.[25] In 1993, as with most other years, a Disney-released product, Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), was the only successful animated feature at the box office, while other films like Once Upon a Forest, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, and Tom and Jerry: The Movie had weak performances.[24] We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story was also part of an economic downfall of the animated feature in early 1990s that included other bombs like Ferngully: The Last Rainforest (1992), Rock-A-Doodle (1992), Bebe's Kids (1992), Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland (1992), Freddie as F.R.O.7 (1992), and Cool World (1992).[24] This period followed a boom of the medium in the late 1980s that consisted of hits like An American Tail (1986), The Land Before Time (1988), Oliver and Company (1988), Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988).[24] Steven Hulett of the union Motion Picture Screen Cartoonists opined the low performances of We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story as well as An American Tail: Fievel Goes West resulted in a lack of focus on plot in a story-driven medium like animation.[22] Critical response[edit] We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story garnered generally mixed reviews from professional critics. As of January 2020, We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story holds an aggregate rating of 38% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 16 critic reviews.[26] An extremely favorable review from Cashbox magazine called it "delightful fun" for children and adults with "warmth, eye-catching visuals and a few chills";[27] while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, in his one-star review, thought it wouldn't compete well in the animated film industry due to its "routine" animation and "shallow and kind of dumb" writing.[28] As a critic for The Baltimore Sun summarized his problems with the film, there were "terrific ideas" blurred by "lacking in wit, emotion, memorable music and, most importantly, magic"; and the voice actors are "shackled with insipid dialogue and few opportunities to shine".[7] Some journalists, including Ebert, found the film more like a television cartoon for kids than an actual feature.[28][29] Coverage included unfavorable comparisons to other Spielberg-produced animations, such as series like Tiny Toon Adventures (1990–1992) and Animaniacs (1993–1998) and films such as The Land Before Time (1988), which also featured dinosaurs.[28][30] Critics also attacked an easter egg as shameless self-promotion for Spielberg, where a poster of Jurassic Park is seen on a theater building during the parade scene.[6][31][32] Several reviews found the story convoluted,[33][34][35] Robert W. Butler calling it "complicated and superficial".[36] Butler and Asbury Park Press writer Eleanor O'Sullivan found the flashback framing device pointless and obnoxious;[32][36] while the Ottawa Citizen's Laura Robin reported inconsistencies, such as with Rex's weight where a light raft holds him yet a bigger dock doesn't.[34] Variety's Daniel M. Kimmel found the villain and his motivations not only convoluted but also ableist, as the film attributes his malevolence to his loss of an eye.[37] Jane Horwitz and Janet Maslin noted other iffy moments, such as the police chase, drugging of dinosaurs, the scary circus scenes, and Screweyes' death.[3][38] The film was considered cliched, preachy, and unoriginal,[6][32][34] such as by Pamella Bruce of the Austin Chronicle; she described it as a rip-off of The Jungle Book (1967) that stole elements of the works of Tim Burton and Alfred Hitchcock.[6] Even a favorable review from the Hartford Courant's Roger Catlin found recycled aspects of the child characters, particularly Cecilia's "poor little rich girl" lifestyle, Louie's Bowery Boys-esque wise-guy attitude, and him running away to join the circus.[39] Reviewers also felt the writing lacked humor and imagination,[28][30] Pensacola News Journal's Marshall Fine claiming the dialogue was more stuffed than witty.[31] The fast pacing was also targeted. Some critics argued it caused elements of the writing, particularly its characters, to not fully develop.[40] Robin wrote Vorb, Stubbs, and Dr. Juliet Bleeb were nothing more than cameos for celebrity voice actors.[34] Charles Soloman of the Los Angeles Times noted many motivations and feelings of the dinosaurs being unknown, specifically with their relationship with Louie and Cecilia and their sacrificing of intelligence, and argued these unclarities made it difficult to be emotionally invested into them.[33] David Elliot argued the pace didn't allowed for relaxation or moments to be fully emotional,[5] and Soloman similarly opined that it made scenes like the flight through Manhattan far less enjoyable.[33] The animation was generally acclaimed,[30][34] a frequently-noted aspect being its mixture of traditional and computer animation.[5][37] 3D backgrounds, such as those of Manhattan during the flight sequence, were a common highlight,[3][33][36][37] Butler also noting the design of NewEyes' spaceship.[36] Catlin praised the characters as "agreeable and fast-moving", and eagerly noted "all sorts of show-offy animation details such as smoke and shadows".[39] However, the visuals also garnered some lukewarm reactions and were considered inferior to Jurassic Park and the works of Disney.[6][28][32][33] Horwitz felt it "lacks the gorgeous background detail" and "heart-tugging romance" of Disney films.[38] Some critics also panned the non-differentiable designs of the kids.[6][39] Multiple reviews positively commented on the voice cast.[3][35][39] Some found Cronktte's voice acting one of the film's most hilarious moments.[5][36] Kimmel called Goodman and Short the top actors, stated Mars and Smith were "handling their chores", and found it amusing Cronkite and Child were voicing animated characters.[37] Robin enjoyed the characters, particularly finding Rex and Captain NewEyes "inspired."[34] Critics also highlighted the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade scene, particularly the dinosaurs' performance of "Roll Back the Rock",[34][36] Kimmel calling it the film's best scene.[37] Accolades[edit] For his work on We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story, supervising sound editor Alexander Campbell Askew was nominated for Outstanding Achievement in Sound Editing for an Animated Feature at the Motion Picture Sound Editors' Golden Reel Awards.[41] Modern reception[edit] Mixed opinions continued in retrospective coverage. Seventeen, in 2017, listed it as one of the 18 best-animated films to view on Netflix;[42] and Country Living, in 2019, included it in a list of the 15 best kid-friendly dinosaur films.[43] On the other hand, The A.V. Club placed it in its 2015 list of the 14 worst dinosaur media;[44] and Paste, that same year, ranked the dinosaur characters the ninth-worst in popular culture, calling them the "silliest, most annoying of the animated dinosaurs".[45] The A.V. Club also ranked Screweyes' devouring by the crows the 19th most terrifying moment in children's entertainment.[46] In a feature about Amblimation for /Film, Dalin Rowell appreciated the film; he felt that despite its inconsistent character animation and bizarre writing, the incorporation of a horror circus and real dinosaurs dancing on city streets would fascinate children's minds, and the character of Rex would appeal to young audiences looking for a supportive and very fun friend.[47] Common Sense Media's Renee Schonfeld called it "clever enough, visually appealing enough, and brisk enough to make it satisfying"; he praised the "engaging" child protagonists, voice acting, and parade scene, although felt it suffered from an "often tangled, overloaded story" with too many characters.[48] References[edit] ^ "We're Back!
