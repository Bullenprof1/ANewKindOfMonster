He designed such products as The Scarlet Brotherhood for AD&D, Beyond Science: A Guide to FX for the Alternity game, and The Green Goblin's Guide to Crime for the Marvel Super Heroes Adventure Game.[1] Reynolds also did some design work such as writing RPGA adventures and contributing to Children of the Night: Ghosts.[citation needed] By 1998, Reynolds had left his web position and was working full-time for WotC as a designer as part of "Team Greyhawk," the creative team tasked with revitalizing TSR/WotC's oldest campaign setting. Reynolds also contributed to the 3rd edition D&D Monster Manual, introducing some new creatures such as the krenshar.[1] After Wizards of the Coast[edit] Reynolds was laid off from WotC in 2002,[citation needed] and afterwards formed his own self-publishing company, "Sean K Reynolds Games."[citation needed] He continued to freelance in the d20 industry while working as an IP developer at Upper Deck.[citation needed] Reynolds was let go from Upper Deck in 2008 and contacted Erik Mona at Paizo Publishing looking to do freelance work, and learned there was a job opportunity due to developer Mike McArtor leaving.[3] In July 2008, Paizo hired Reynolds as a developer on the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.[citation needed] Jason Bulmahn has described him as a "critical part of the design team".[4] In March 2014, Sean left Paizo to move to Indiana[5] and in May 2014 he announced that he was returning to Seattle and Wizards of the Coast for a contract position managing their third-party licensing.[6] Publications[edit] Books he has worked on for the d20-based 3rd edition include the Living Greyhawk Gazetteer, Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, Savage Species, and Ghostwalk (co-written with Monte Cook). The Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting won the Origins Award for Best Role-Playing Game Supplement of 2001.[7] It made the Amazon.ca bestseller list at number 47 in September 2002.[8] Reynolds identified the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting as his favorite individual product from throughout his career, stating that it "was a huge amount of work but was so worth it because it is a great product".[9] In May 2003 his book Races of Faerun (co-authored with Matt Forbeck, James Jacobs, and Eric L. Boyd) landed on the same bestseller list at number 42.[10] References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h Kenson, Stephen (April 2000). "ProFiles: Sean Reynolds". Dragon.
