A local native American named Dakota (Trujillo) is opposed to the plans, which will destroy his ancestor's heritage. He also feels his people were tricked into signing away their land, and is doing all he can to stop the bulldozers moving in. Dakota's nephew is Jake Roundtree (Brand), the town sheriff who has to abide by the law. Frustrated and angry, Dakota decides to use ancient magic to save the town and performs a rite by which evil spirits possess three dinosaur skeletons, bringing them to life. The rampaging skeletons attack, and kill everyone they meet. It is up to the sheriff and his wife Emma (Mitchell) to figure out a way to stop them. Finally, Dakota feels guilty and also sets out to stop the dinosaurs.
