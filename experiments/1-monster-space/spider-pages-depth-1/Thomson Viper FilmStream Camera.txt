The Thomson Viper FilmStream Camera is a digital movie camera produced by Thomson Multimedia (now Technicolor SA) that was first introduced in the early 2000s,[1] during the rise in popularity of digital cinematography in feature films. The subsequent developments in HD, UHD, and HDR cameras were influenced by the Viper and its contemporaries.[2] History[edit] The Viper FilmStream was announced in 2002[1] by Thomson after being developed by its Grass Valley subsidiary[3] which it had purchased earlier that year.[4] It followed on the tails of the early Sony CineAlta cameras and preceded the Panavision Genesis[5] by less than a year. One feature of the Viper was that it could replay takes immediately after they were shot, which certain cameras of the era (such as early versions of the Genesis)[6] could not. Films shot on the Viper include Michael Mann's Collateral, Miami Vice, and Public Enemies and David Fincher's Zodiac and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Cinematographer Dion Beebe described the Viper as the "primary camera" on Collateral;[7] on both Zodiac[8] and Collateral 35mm film was used only for overcranking.[9][10] Zodiac was the first digital feature film made by a major studio without using videotape or compression in its capture or editing.[8][11] Fincher became interested in using the camera on a feature film after shooting commercials for Nike and Xelibri with it.[12] In 2017, Grass Valley received a Scientific and Technical Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for its Viper.[2] Specifications[edit] [3] Sensors: : 3 x 2/3" HD-DPM 9.2 million pixel CCDs Effective pixels: 1920 x 4320; aspect ratio 16:9 (1.77:1) in 1080 and 720 line modes, or 2.37:1 in 1080p mode Bit depth: 12-bit linear A-D conversion, mapped to 10-bit logarithmic signals for downstream processing Power: 12V DC nominal (11.5 – 17V); ~44W (including 2" viewfinder and FilmStream adapter) Mount: Standard B4 lens mount for popular digital cinematography prime and zoom lenses Weight: 4.3 kg including 2" viewfinder and FilmStream adapter Overall dimensions: 197mm x 117mm x 349mm Optical filters: f1.4 prism system; first filter wheel clear, 2-stop, 4-stop, 6-stop ND; second filter wheel clear, 4-point star, 6-point star, soft focus Formats and Frames per second: 1080p at 23.98, 24, 25, and 29.97 fps 1080i at 50 and 59.94 Hz 720p at 23.98, 24, 25, 29.97, 50, and 59.94 fps.
