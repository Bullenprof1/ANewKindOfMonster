Walt Disney Television's television productions were broadcast, mostly on Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD, and ABC. Today, the majority of the 'old' Walt Disney Television's productions are animated series which are produced through Walt Disney Television Inc. (simply known as 'New' Walt Disney Television or just Disney Television). The last known live-action series produced by Walt Disney Television was Smart Guy which ran for three seasons from 1997 to 1999 on the now-defunct WB Television Network. It was succeeded in purpose by It's a Laugh Productions.

Most studios were generating revenue by selling off their permanent television rights to their films made before 1948, while Disney held on to the company's film rights. Thus Walt Disney Productions was the first of the film industry, which saw television as an adversary, to enter the television production field. Walt Disney Productions did an hour-long special on Christmas Day 1950 for NBC then in 1951 for CBS. The specials used Disney film clips, short films and promoted the upcoming Alice in Wonderland theatrical film. Both specials had excellent ratings. The networks pursued Disney to do a full series for them. Disney used this interest in a series to request funding for Disneyland, which the newly merged American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres did for its American Broadcasting Company (ABC) with the airing of the Disneyland anthology series. The "Operation Undersea" episode of the series garnered Disney its first Emmy Award. The series quickly became ABC's first series to hit the top 20 in ratings.[1] Disney's entry into television impacted the television industry as the Disney anthology show marked a move from live to filmed delivery of television shows. Filming made it possible for higher production value. Also, a couple of the major film studios copied the show's format with MGM Parade and Warner Bros. Presents. Both shows did not last.[1] With the series' "Davy Crockett" episodes generating high sale of merchandise, Disney Productions produced The Mickey Mouse Club, the first youth audience television program and a daily afternoon show.[1] History[edit] Walt Disney Television was formed in 1983, as the Walt Disney Pictures Television Division, the name was later shortened to Walt Disney Pictures Television in 1986 and later shortened to Walt Disney Television in 1988. Until 1983, Disney shows were aired under the banner of the parent company, then named Walt Disney Productions. In August 1994, with the departure of Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, its filmed entertainment business was split into two, with Walt Disney Pictures continuing with motion pictures and the newly created Walt Disney Television#Walt Disney Television and Telecommunications for television under Joe Roth and Richard Frank respectively.[2] At the time when Disney merged with Capital Cities/ABC, Disney Television was a part of Walt Disney Television and Telecommunications (WDTT).[3] With the retirement of WDTT president Dennis Hightower in April 1996 and ongoing post-merger reorganization, Walt Disney Television (along with its Animation unit) was transferred back to The Walt Disney Studios.[4] The Walt Disney Television group, upon the departure of its president Dean Valentine in September 1997, was split into two units: Walt Disney Television (WDT) and Walt Disney Network Television (WDNT), reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman Joe Roth. WDT would be headed by Charles Hirschhorn as president and consisted of The Wonderful World of Disney's telefilms for ABC, the-direct-to video-unit, and Walt Disney Television Animation. WDNT would handle primetime programming, headed by David Neuman as president.[5] Neuman was also named president of Touchstone Television.[6] In March 1998, WDNT was placed under Buena Vista TV Productions, a newly formed group under chairman Lloyd Braun, along with Touchstone Television.[7] in June 1998, Neuman left along with his top two executives due to the reorganization.[8] In late 1999, Walt Disney Television Studios (also called Buena Vista Television Group or Buena Vista Television Productions), were transferred from the Disney Studios to the ABC Television Network to merge with ABC's primetime division, ABC Entertainment, forming the ABC Entertainment Television Group. Walt Disney Television Studios was later folded into Touchstone Television (became ABC Studios, now known as ABC Signature) in 2003 while its name disappeared from new cartoons from Walt Disney Television Animation (now Disney Television Animation, which is now a unit of Disney Channels Worldwide).[9][10][11] Names[edit] Walt Disney Productions Television Division (1983) Walt Disney Pictures Television Division (1983–1985) Walt Disney Pictures Television (1985–1988) Walt Disney Television (1985–2003) (become current name of television asset divisions in 2019) Walt Disney Pictures and Television (1988–2007) Television series[edit] Symbol (1984–1991) Dumbo's Circus (1985–1986) Win, Lose or Draw#Teen Win, Lose or Draw (1989-1992) MMC (1990–1996) Adventures in Wonderland (1991–1995) STAT (1990) Donald's Quack Attack (1992–2000) Mickey's Mouse Tracks (1992–1994) Mickey Mouse and Friends (1994–1996) Zapping Zone (1997–2004) PB&J Otter (1998–2000) The Book of Pooh (2001–2002) Zapping Zone (II) (2001) Stanley (2001–2004) Title Year Network Notes Good Morning, Mickey! 1983-1992 Disney Channel produced by Disney Television Animation Donald Duck Presents 1983-1992 Disney Channel produced by Disney Television Animation Welcome to Pooh Corner 1983-1986 Disney Channel produced by Disney Television Animation You and Me Kid 1982-1984 Disney Channel produced by Walt Disney Productions Adventures of the Gummi Bears 1985–1991 NBC/ABC produced by Disney Television Animation The Wuzzles 1985 CBS produced by Disney Television Animation Sidekicks 1986-1987 Disney Channel co-production with Motown Productions DuckTales 1987–1990 Syndication produced by Disney Television Animation The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh 1988–1991 ABC produced by Disney Television Animation Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers 1989–1990 Syndication produced by Disney Television Animation TaleSpin 1990–1992 Syndication produced by Disney Television Animation The 100 Lives of Black Jack Savage 1991 NBC co-production with Stephen J.

The division provided movies for The Wonderful World of Disney. Telefilms history[edit] With the purchase of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., Disney CEO Michael Eisner wanted to relaunch The Wonderful World of Disney on ABC in 1996 with a movie franchise. Walt Disney Telefilms was formed to produce films for the anthology TV series[12] by 1995. Leah Keith was transferred from Walt Disney Pictures that year to the telefilms division.[13] Hollywood Pictures executive vice president Charles Hirschhorn oversaw Walt Disney Telefilms as president in June 1996, reporting to Dean Valentine, president of Walt Disney Television and Walt Disney Television Animation, for the Telefilms unit.[14] Mike Karz, a former vice president of Mandeville Films, signed a first look deal with the company through his shingle, Karz Entertainment, based at Walt Disney Studios in May 1997.[15] On September 28, 1997, the division launched the anthology show.[16] The division produced 17 films in nine months[12] while it only expected to provide 16 movies. On October 5, 1997, Disney Telefilms' first production, Toothless, debuted on The Wonderful World of Disney.[17] The Walt Disney Television group, upon the departure of Dean Valentine in September 1997, was split into two units: Walt Disney Television (WDT) and Walt Disney Network Television (WDNT). WDT would be headed by Hirschhorn as president and consisted of Disney Telefilms and Walt Disney Television Animation, including Disney MovieToons/Disney Video Premiere.[5] Leah Keith and Peter Green were promoted to production vice presidents for the division in March 1998.[13] Telefilms filmography[edit] Title Release date Production company(ies) Notes source 1997[edit] Toothless October 5, 1997 1st Disney Telefilms movie [17] Tower of Terror October 26, 1997 ZM Productions 1st theme park attraction movie [16] Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella November 2, 1997 [17] Angels in the Endzone November 9, 1997 Caravan Pictures [18] Oliver Twist November 16, 1997 A retelling of the Dickens tale starring Richard Dreyfuss and Elijah Wood [16][17] The Love Bug November 30, 1997 Remake of the 1968 film [17] Flash December 21, 1997 [16] 1998[edit] Principal Takes a Holiday January 4, 1998 [18] Ruby Bridges January 18, 1998 A docu-drama at New Orleans all-white school, which takes in its first African American girl student base [17][13] The Garbage Picking Field Goal Kicking Philadelphia Phenomenon February 15, 1998 Tony Danza as a trash man who would become a kicker for the Philadelphia Eagles [17] Goldrush: A Real Life Alaskan Adventure March 8, 1998 [18] Miracle at Midnight May 17, 1998 Davis Entertainment Starring Mia Farrow, Sam Waterston and Justin Whalin, a fact-based story in which the Danish save thousands from the Nazi [17][16][19] See also[edit] Disney Television Animation Walt Disney Television, current television division using former production company name Jetix Animation Concepts List of Disney television series References[edit] ^ a b c Griffin, Sean.
