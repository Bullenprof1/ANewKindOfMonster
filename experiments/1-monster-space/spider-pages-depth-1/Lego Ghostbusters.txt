The product line focuses on the Ghostbusters characters who start a ghost-catching business in New York City. Lego Ghostbusters aimed to recreate the main characters in Lego form, including Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, Egon Spengler and Winston Zeddemore.[10] Development[edit] Lego Ghostbusters began with the release of a user-designed construction set based on the Ectomobile (or Ecto-1), the vehicle that features in the films. The design was submitted to Lego Cuusoo by Australian video game artist Brent Waller. The design achieved 10,000 votes, after which it was selected for production. It was chosen for having "broad worldwide appeal and the fact that the model lends itself to challenging and creative building for both children and adult fans". The set was produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the original 1984 film.[11] Construction sets[edit] The Lego Ghostbusters theme was launched at the New York Toy Fair in 2014.[12] Following the successful campaign by Brent Waller for the Lego Cuusoo idea, The Lego Group released the first construction toy set based on the film. Ghostbusters Ecto-1 (set number: 21108) was based on the Ectomobile from the Ghostbusters franchise and was released in June 2014. The release of the set coincided with the 30th anniversary of the original 1984 Ghostbusters film on 7 June 2014.[12] The set included Lego minifigures of Dr. Peter Venkman, Dr. Egon Spengler and Winston Zeddemore. It also included paranormal detection equipment, a removable roof and a tracking computer.[13] In 2016, Firehouse Headquarters (set number: 75827)[14][15] a second set based on the Ghostbusters' firehouse was released on January 2016. Firehouse Headquarters (set number: 75827)[16][17] was the largest set.[18][19][20][21] The set contained 4634 pieces with nine minifigures and was recommended for builders with an age rating of 16+. The Firehouse Headquarters[22] had nine rooms including a laboratory, containment unit, darkroom, garage bay, office area, kitchen, sleeping quarters, bathroom and recreation room.[23] The set featured opening walls for easy play access.[24] The doors of the Firehouse Headquarters could open to fit the Ghostbusters Ecto-1(set number: 21108) inside.[25] The set included three ghost figures, Slimer, Pink Ghost and Blue Ghost.[26] The Lego Group announced that Firehouse Headquarters (set number: 75827) will be retiring soon.[27] Later, Ecto-1 & 2 (set number: 75828) based on Ghostbusters: Answer the Call was released on July 2016.[28] Ecto-1 & 2 (set number: 75828)[29][30][31] was the third set. The set featured the Ecto-1 vehicle, Ecto-2 motorbike and five minifigures[32][33] with a ghost figure.[34][35] The set contained 556 pieces and was recommended for builders with an age rating of 8-14.[36][37][38][39] Lego also used this license for character and level packs in the Lego Dimensions toys-to-life video game.[40][41] In 2018, Peter Venkman & Slimer (set number: 41622)[42][43][44] was released on July 2018[45] as a sub-brand of the Lego Brickheadz theme.[46] The set contained 228 pieces.[47][48][49] It also featured Peter Venkman equipped with a Proton pack and Slimer with hot dogs.[50] Each of the Lego BrickHeadz construction characters came with its own buildable collector's baseplate. In 2020, it was announced that the ECTO-1 (set number: 10274)[51][52][53][54] based on the Ghostbusters: Afterlife would be released on 15 November 2020.[55][56] The set contains 2352 pieces and is recommended for builders with an age rating of 18+.[57][58] Video games[edit] Two games feature elements relating to Ghostbusters. Lego Dimensions (2015)[59][60][61] developed by Traveller's Tales features content based on both the original Ghostbusters and its 2016 remake.[62] A "level pack"[63] includes an additional level that recreates the events of the original film and adds Peter Venkman[b] as a playable character, with the unlockable ability to play as the other three Ghostbusters. A "story pack"[65][66] offers an extended six-level story campaign retelling the events of the 2016 film, and includes a playable Abby Yates[67][68][c], who can also be used to play as the other three Ghostbusters. Additional "fun packs"[69][70] add Slimer[71] and Stay Puft[72] as playable characters.[73] Lego Legacy: Heroes Unboxed (2020) was developed by Gameloft.[74][75] Lego Legacy: Heroes Unboxed was released exclusively for Microsoft Windows, Android and iOS devices on 27 February 2020.[76][77] It also includes Peter Venkman,[78] Ray Stanz,[79] Egon Spengler and Winston Zeddemore as a playable characters.
