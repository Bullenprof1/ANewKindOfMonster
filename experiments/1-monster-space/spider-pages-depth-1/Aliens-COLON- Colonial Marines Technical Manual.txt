It describes the equipment of the Colonial Marines in great detail and contains expansive descriptions of the UD4L Cheyenne dropship and the 'Conestoga'-class spaceships (such as the Sulaco), both featured in the film. The manual also contains information about the organization of the Colonial Marines, and while it attempts to stay faithful to the films it adds and expands upon a number of topics not depicted in the film, such as artillery and tanks. Often these are also commented on in-character by Colonial Marines. The manual ends with a series of transcripts between Weyland-Yutani employees as they discuss their theories on Xenomorphic Endoparasitoid biology and its possible exploitation. Many elements introduced in the book, especially weapons including the M83 SADAR, have since been featured in expanded universe Alien and Alien vs. Predator media, including comic books, novels, and video games. Titan Books released a revised edition of the book on May 29, 2012, likely to promote the video game Aliens: Colonial Marines, a direct sequel to the second film.[1] Sources[edit] ^ a b c d e Amazon: Aliens: Colonial Marines Technical Manual (2012) v t e Alien Films Alien (1979) Aliens (1986) Alien 3 (1992) Alien Resurrection (1997) Prometheus (2012) Alien: Covenant (2017) Media Soundtracks Alien Aliens Alien 3 Alien Resurrection Prometheus Alien: Covenant Comics Alien: The Illustrated Story Dark Horse line Superman/Aliens Batman/Aliens WildC.A.T.s/Aliens Green Lantern Versus Aliens Judge Dredd vs. Aliens Novels Alien: Out of the Shadows Aliens: Earth Hive Aliens: Nightmare Asylum Aliens: The Female War Aliens: Phalanx Games Alien (1982) Alien (1984) Aliens: The Computer Game (Activision) Aliens: The Computer Game (Software Studios) Aliens (1990) Aliens Adventure Game (tabletop) Alien 3 Alien 3: The Gun Aliens: A Comic Book Adventure Alien Trilogy Aliens Online Alien Resurrection Aliens: Thanatos Encounter Aliens Infestation Aliens: Colonial Marines Alien: Isolation Aliens: Fireteam Other media Aliens: Colonial Marines Technical Manual Alien: Isolation – The Digital Series Universe Characters Ellen Ripley Ash Bishop Amanda Ripley David 8 Corporal Dwayne Hicks Hudson Concepts USS Sulaco Alien Other Accolades for the film series Alien War Alien vs. Predator franchise Related Ripley (crater) Alien 2: On Earth Memory: The Origins of Alien Category This article about a science fiction book is a stub.
