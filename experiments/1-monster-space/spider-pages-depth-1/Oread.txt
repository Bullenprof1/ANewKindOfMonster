They differ from each other according to their dwelling: the Idaeae were from Mount Ida, Peliades from Mount Pelion, etc. They were associated with Artemis, since the goddess, when she went out hunting, preferred mountains and rocky precipices. The term itself appears to be Hellenistic, first attested in Bion of Smyrna's Ἐπιτάφιος Ἀδώνιδος and thus post-Classical.[1] List of Oreads[edit] The number of Oreads includes but is not limited to: List of Oreads Name Location Relations and Notes Britomartis Chelone changed by Hermes into a tortoise Claea Mount Calathion, Messenia [2] Cyllene or Kyllene Mount Cyllene [3] Daphnis Mount Parnassos [4] Echo Mount Cithaeron loved Narcissus[5] Eidothea The Idaeae Mount Ida, Crete [6][7] • Adrasteia • Cynosura • Helike • Ida Nomia Mount Nomia, Arcadia a friend of Callisto[8] Oenone Othreis Mount Othrys, Malis [9] Penelope Phigalia Pitys [10] Sinoe Mount Sinoe, Arcadia [11] Sose The Sphragitides or Cithaeronides Mount Cithaeron [12][13] Honours[edit] Mount Oread in Lawrence, Kansas Oread Lake in Antarctica References[edit] ^ Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon s.v. text at Perseus project ^ Pausanias, Description of Greece 3.26.11 ^ Bibliotheca 3.8.1 ^ Pausanias, Description of Greece 10.5.5 ^ Aristophanes, Thesmophoriazusae 970 ^ Bibliotheca 1.4.5 ^ Hyginus, Astronomica, 2.2 ^ Pausanias, Description of Greece 8.38.0 ^ Antoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses 13 ^ Propertius, Elegies 1. 18 ^ Pausanias, Description of Greece 8.30.2 ^ Plutarch, Life of Aristides 11. 3 ^ Pausanias, Description of Greece 9.3.9
