Event release poster Mortal Kombat: Live Tour was a martial art theatrical stage show featuring Mortal Kombat characters, sound, and laser light effects on stage. The plot was based on three fighters rescuing their friends and retrieving a magic amulet from the evil master of Outworld, Shao Kahn, in order to save the Earth. The show debuted at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on September 14, 1995, followed by a 200 city road trip into 1996. It replicated Mortal Kombat martial arts and video game moves on stage mixed with dancing and music. Lip synching were pre-recorded and used to demonstrate the official MK sound effects, though there was no graphic violence or Fatalities visible in the show. The audience participated by yelling "Run!" or "Kick him!" as part of the live action.
