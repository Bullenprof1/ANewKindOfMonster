A Haunting is an American paranormal drama anthology television series that depicts eyewitness accounts of alleged possession, exorcism, and ghostly encounters. The program features narrations, interviews, and dramatic re-enactments based on various accounts of alleged paranormal experiences at reportedly haunted and mostly residential locations.

The specials were executive produced by Tom Naughton and Nicolas Valcour for New Dominion Pictures.[1] Based on strong ratings, A Haunting became a weekly series on the Discovery Channel and was produced by Larry Silverman.[2] Production of new episodes ceased after four seasons in 2007.[3] Reruns of A Haunting continued to air on the Discovery Channel and its sister networks. In 2012, Destination America brought back A Haunting based on strong interest from fans and viewers.[3][4] Seasons five through nine have aired on Destination America and The Learning Channel.[5][6][7][8] The series has featured several alleged paranormal encounters, including traditional hauntings, demonic activity, ghost attacks, possessions, and cryptic visions.[9][10] The series covers incidents from various locations across the United States, as well as five episodes that were set in Canada, England, Ireland, and Taiwan. Episodes may be set in houses, apartments, farms, commercial areas, and even vast outdoor regions.[2][11][12] Most episodes present several accounts of paranormal experiences through cinematic re-enactments, which are accompanied by commentary from eyewitnesses and investigators themselves.[13] According to Silverman, the show's writers search for stories and then filter out accounts with enough substantial content.[2] He has further added that the episodes are strictly based on the accounts of victims, although the Discovery Channel did compel the show's producers to sanitize certain case histories due to their graphic sexual and violent content.[2] Billy Bean, whose real-life experiences were first featured in the episode "House of the Dead", claimed that the show's producers left out some of his story and that "some of the content was altered."[14] Episodes within the series follow a frequently recurring pattern, in which victims of hauntings begin noticing peculiar incidents that gradually become more frequent and bizarre. Denial is most often the first reaction. As the situation escalates, however, and every possible conventional explanation is explored and found wanting, they either contact a paranormal investigator, a member of the clergy, or a spiritual medium for assistance. In some cases, victims are able to successfully resolve their paranormal issues, while in others, victims are forced to vacate their residence.[15][16] Certain episodes have also featured commentary from famed demonologist and clairvoyant Ed and Lorraine Warren, who have actually investigated some of the cases featured on the series. The episode "The Dark Side" was dedicated to the memory of Ed, who died in 2006.[16] Episodes[edit] Main article: List of A Haunting episodes Season Episodes Originally aired First aired Last aired Network Specials 2 August 6, 2002 (2002-08-06) 2002 (2002) Discovery Channel 1 8 October 28, 2005 (2005-10-28) March 24, 2006 (2006-03-24) 2 8 August 10, 2006 (2006-08-10) September 28, 2006 (2006-09-28) 3 10 October 5, 2006 (2006-10-05) December 14, 2006 (2006-12-14) 4 13 August 10, 2007 (2007-08-10) November 9, 2007 (2007-11-09) 5 10 October 12, 2012 (2012-10-12) December 16, 2012 (2012-12-16) Destination America 6 4 September 29, 2013 (2013-09-29) October 20, 2013 (2013-10-20) 7 16 August 1, 2014 (2014-08-01) January 23, 2015 (2015-01-23) 8 10 January 3, 2016 (2016-01-03) March 20, 2016 (2016-03-20) 9 12 October 21, 2016 (2016-10-21) March 31, 2017 (2017-03-31) TLC 10 14 October 9, 2017 (2017-10-09) September 13, 2018 (2018-09-13) 11 10 May 27, 2019 (2019-05-27) July 29, 2019 (2019-07-29) Broadcast[edit] The show originally aired from August 6, 2002 to November 9, 2007 on the Discovery Channel, which produced four seasons of 39 episodes.
