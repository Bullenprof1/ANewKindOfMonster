New Objectivity (a translation of the German Neue Sachlichkeit,[1] alternatively translated as "New Sobriety" or "New matter-of-factness") was an art movement that emerged in Germany in the early 1920s as a counter to expressionism.[2] The term applies to a number of artistic forms, including film.

Notable directors[edit] The director most associated with the movement is Georg Wilhelm Pabst.[4] Pabst's films of the 1920s concentrate on subjects such as abortion, prostitution, labor disputes, homosexuality, and addiction. His cool and critical 1925 Joyless Street is a landmark of the objective style.[5] Pabst's 1930 pacifist sound film Westfront 1918 views the World War I experience in a bleak, matter-of-fact way.[6][7] With its clear denunciation of war, it was soon banned as unsuitable for public viewing. Other directors in the style included Ernő Metzner, Berthold Viertel,[8] and Gerhard Lamprecht. Decline[edit] The movement ended essentially in 1933 with the fall of the Weimar Republic.[9] Films[edit] Films with New Objectivity themes and visual style include: Joyless Street, 1925[10] Secrets of a Soul, 1926 Uneasy Money, 1926 The Love of Jeanne Ney, 1927 Police Report: Hold-Up, short subject, 1928 People on Sunday, 1930 Westfront 1918, 1930 [11][12] References[edit] ^ MoMA|German Expressionism Style: New Objectivity ^ Cultural changes: developments in architecture, art and the cinema -
