Jensen Deputy Director MG John C. Andonie[2][3] Command Sergeant Major CSM John F. Sampa The Army National Guard (ARNG), in conjunction with the Air National Guard, is an organized militia force and a federal military reserve force of the United States Army. They are simultaneously part of two different organizations: the Army National Guard of each state, most territories, and the District of Columbia (also referred to as the Militia of the United States), and the Army National Guard of the United States (as part of the United States National Guard). The Army National Guard is divided into subordinate units stationed in each U.S. state and territory, as well the District of Columbia, operating under their respective governors and governor-equivalents.[4] The foundation for what became the Army National Guard occurred in the city of Salem, Massachusetts, in 1692, the first time that a regiment of militia drilled for the common defense of a multi-community area.[5] Contents 1 Activation 2 History 3 Prominent members 3.1 U.S. Presidents 4 Units and formations 4.1 Commands 4.2 Divisions 4.3 Multifunctional Support Brigades 4.3.1 Maneuver Enhancement Brigades 4.3.2 Field Artillery Brigades 4.3.3 Sustainment Brigades 4.3.4 Military Intelligence Brigades 4.4 Functional Support Brigades & Groups 4.4.1 Engineer Brigades 4.4.2 Air Defense Artillery Brigades 4.4.3 Theater Tactical Signal Brigades 4.4.4 Military Police Brigades 4.4.5 Theater and Combat Aviation Brigades 4.4.6 Other brigades 4.4.7 Other Groups 4.5 Regular Army – Army National Guard Partnership 5 By state 6 Legacy units and formations 7 Leadership 7.1 List of chiefs and directors 8 See also 9 Notes 10 References 11 External links Activation[edit] The Army National Guard as currently authorized and organized operates under Title 10 of the United States Code when under federal control, and Title 32 of the United States Code and applicable state laws when under state control. The Army National Guard may be called up for active duty by the state or territorial governors to help respond to domestic emergencies and disasters, such as those caused by hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes, as well as civil disorder.[4] The District of Columbia Army National Guard is a federal militia, controlled by the President of the United States with authority delegated to the Secretary of Defense, and through him to the Secretary of the Army.[6] Members or units of the Army National Guard may be ordered, temporarily or indefinitely, into the service of the United States.[7][8] If mobilized for federal service, the member or unit becomes part of the Army National Guard of the United States, which is a reserve component of the United States Army.[9][10][11] Individuals volunteering for active federal service may do so subject to the consent of their governors.[12] Governors generally cannot veto involuntary activations of individuals or units for federal service, either for training or national emergency.[13] (See Perpich v. Department of Defense.) The President may also call up members and units of the Army National Guard, in its status as the militia of the several states, to repel invasion, suppress rebellion, or enforce federal laws.[14] The Army National Guard of the United States is one of two organizations administered by the National Guard Bureau, the other being the Air National Guard of the United States. The Director of the Army National Guard is the head of the organization, and reports to the Chief of the National Guard Bureau. Because the Army National Guard is both the militia of the several states and a federal reserve component of the Army, neither the Chief of the National Guard Bureau nor the Director of the Army National Guard "commands" it. This operational command authority is performed in each state or territory by the State Adjutant General, and in the District of Columbia by the Commanding General of the District of Columbia National Guard when a unit is in its militia status. While under federal activation, the operational command authority is transferred to the commanders of the unified combatant commands, who command all U.S. forces within their area of responsibility. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau and the Director of the Army National Guard serve as the channel of communications between the Department of the Army and the Army National Guard in each state and territory, and administer federal programs, policies, and resources for the National Guard.[15] The Army National Guard's portion of the president's proposed federal budget for Fiscal Year 2018 is approximately $16.2 billion to support an end strength of 343,000, including appropriations for personnel pay and allowance, facilities maintenance, construction, equipment maintenance and other activities.[16] History[edit] Main article: History of the US Army National Guard Main article: Militia (United States) Play media ARNG recruits arriving at Fort Jackson for BCT Prominent members[edit] Main article: Prominent members of the US Army National Guard U.S. Presidents[edit] Main article: List of Presidents of the United States by military service Of the 45[a] individuals to serve as President of the United States as of 2021[update], 33 had military experience.

Grant, having left the Army as a captain, at the start of the Civil War he served in the Illinois Militia as aide de camp and mustering officer for Governor Richard Yates.[43][44] He held these positions until being appointed commander of the 21st Illinois Infantry, which set him on the path to becoming a general and commander of all Union armies.[45] Rutherford B. Hayes, joined a militia company in 1846 intending to fight in the Mexican–American War, but resigned because of ill health.[46] Enlisted as a private in a Cincinnati militia company at the start of the Civil War in 1861, and was elected commander with the rank of captain.

Morgan as Quartermaster General with the rank of brigadier general. He later served as Morgan's inspector general, responsible for visiting New York's front line units, assessing conditions and recommending improvements.[50] Benjamin Harrison, commissioned in the Indiana Militia by Governor Oliver P. Morton to recruit a regiment during the Civil War, he was subsequently appointed a second lieutenant and captain in and then colonel and commander of the 70th Indiana Infantry Regiment. He received the brevet of brigadier general as a commendation of his service, and later commanded a brigade.[51][52][53] He also enrolled in the militia again during labor unrest in Indianapolis in 1877.[54] William McKinley, joined a volunteer militia company called the Poland Guards at the start of the Civil War. The company was subsequently mustered in as part of the 23rd Ohio Infantry, the same regiment in which President Hayes served. McKinley ended the war as a major and chief of staff for division commander Samuel S. Carroll.[55][56] Theodore Roosevelt, commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 8th New York Infantry Regiment in 1884, he served until 1888 and attained the rank of captain.

In 2001 a review of his war record led to a posthumous award of the Medal of Honor.[57][58] Harry S. Truman, served in the Missouri Army National Guard from 1905 to 1911, rising to the rank of corporal. During World War I he rejoined and was commissioned a first lieutenant in the 2nd Missouri Field Artillery. This regiment was federalized as the 129th Field Artillery, and Truman commanded Battery D as a captain. He continued to serve in the Army Reserve, retiring as a colonel in 1953.[59][60][61] (Note: President George W. Bush served in the National Guard in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and he was the first Air National Guard member to attain the presidency.)[62] Units and formations[edit] Deployable Army units are organized as table of organization and equipment (TOE) organizations or modified table of organization and equipment (MTOE) organizations. Non-deployable units, such as a state's joint force headquarters or regional training institutes are administered as table of distribution and allowance (TDA) units.[63] Commands[edit] 46th Military Police Command (46th MPC) (MI ARNG) 135th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary) (135th ESC) (AL ARNG) 167th Sustainment Command (Theater) (167th TSC) (AL ARNG) 184th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary) (184th ESC) (MS ARNG) 263rd Army Air and Missile Defense Command (263rd AAMDC) (SC ARNG) Divisions[edit] In addition to many deployable units which are non-divisional, the Army National Guard's deployable units include eight Infantry divisions.[64] These divisions, their subordinate brigades or brigades with which the divisions have a training oversight relationship, and the states represented by the largest units include:[65] 28th Infantry Division (PA ARNG) 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (2nd IBCT) (PA ARNG) 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team (56th SBCT) (PA ARNG) 28th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade (28th ECAB) (PA ARNG) 29th Infantry Division (VA ARNG) 30th Armored Brigade Combat Team (30th ABCT) (NC ARNG) 53rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (53rd IBCT) (FL ARNG) 116th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (116th IBCT) (VA ARNG) 29th Combat Aviation Brigade (29th CAB) (MD ARNG) 142nd Field Artillery Brigade (142nd FAB) (AR ARNG) 34th Infantry Division (MN ARNG) 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team (1st ABCT) (MN ARNG) 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (2nd IBCT) (IA ARNG) 32nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (32nd IBCT) (WI ARNG) 116th Cavalry Brigade Combat Team (116th CBCT) (ID ARNG) 34th Combat Aviation Brigade (34th CAB) (MN ARNG) 35th Infantry Division (KS ARNG) 33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (33rd IBCT) (IL ARNG) 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (39th IBCT) (AR ARNG) 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (45th IBCT) (OK ARNG) 35th Combat Aviation Brigade (35th CAB) (MO ARNG) 36th Infantry Division (TX ARNG) 56th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (56th IBCT) (TX ARNG) 72nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (72nd IBCT) (TX ARNG) 155th Armored Brigade Combat Team (155th ABCT) (MS ARNG) 256th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (256th IBCT) (LA ARNG) 36th Combat Aviation Brigade (36th CAB) (TX ARNG) 38th Infantry Division (IN ARNG) 37th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (37th IBCT) (OH ARNG) 76th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (76th IBCT) (IN ARNG) 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment (278th ACR) (TN ARNG) 38th Combat Aviation Brigade (38th CAB) (IN ARNG) 40th Infantry Division (CA ARNG) 29th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (29th IBCT) (HI ARNG) 41st Infantry Brigade Combat Team (41st IBCT) (OR ARNG) 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (79th IBCT) (CA ARNG) 40th Combat Aviation Brigade (40th CAB) (CA ARNG) 42nd Infantry Division (NY ARNG) 27th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (27th IBCT) (NY ARNG) 44th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (44th IBCT) (NJ ARNG) 86th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (86th IBCT) (VT ARNG) 42nd Combat Aviation Brigade (42nd CAB) (NY ARNG) 197th Field Artillery Brigade (197th FAB) (NH ARNG) 26th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade (26th MEB) (MA ARNG) Multifunctional Support Brigades[edit] The Army National Guard fields 37 multifunctional support brigades.

Each were headed by a major general who reported to the chief of the National Guard Bureau. The head of the Army National Guard was originally established as the chief of the Army Division at the National Guard Bureau. The position was downgraded to brigadier general in 1962 due to force reduction. It was renamed to Director of the Army National Guard and elevated back to major general in 1970. The position was later elevated to the rank of lieutenant general in 2001. The Army National Guard is also authorized a deputy director which was originally established as a brigadier general office in 1970. It was elevated to the rank of major general in 2006. The director of the Army National Guard oversees a staff which aids in planning and day-to-day organization and management. In addition to a chief of staff, the Director's staff includes several special staff members, including a chaplain and protocol and awards specialists. It also includes a primary staff, which is organized as directorates, divisions, and branches. The directorates of the Army National Guard staff are arranged along the lines of a typical American military staff: G-1 for personnel; G-2 for intelligence; G-3 for plans, operations and training; G-4 for logistics; G-5 for strategic plans, policy and communications; G-6 for communications; and G-8 for budgets and financial management.
