All times it was reverted. A Skullcrawler article is desperately needed for it to be valid. Visokor (talk) 09:01, 9 April 2017 (UTC) Templates are for articles, placeholders are useless. Make an article yourself if you want it to be included. I have no interest in pleasing your personal opinion about how important they are. I doesn't even have to be a good article, just a stub with evidence of notability. I have made dozens of article that I have added to templates, after I made them. It's really not that hard and it's not that hard to recognize navigantion box guidlines.★Trekker (talk) 09:07, 9 April 2017 (UTC)
