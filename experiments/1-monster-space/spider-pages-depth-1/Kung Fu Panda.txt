The first two were distributed by Paramount Pictures, while the third film was distributed by 20th Century Fox. Three shorts, Secrets of the Furious Five (2008), Kung Fu Panda Holiday Special (2010) and Kung Fu Panda: Secrets of the Masters (2011), were also released. A television series for Nickelodeon television network, Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness, premiered in 2011. A second series, Kung Fu Panda: The Paws of Destiny, was released on Amazon Prime in November 2018. The franchise, set in a fantasy wuxia genre version of ancient China populated by anthropomorphic animals, features the adventures of Po Ping, a giant panda, who was improbably chosen as the prophesied Dragon Warrior. Although his status is initially doubted, Po proves himself worthy as he strives to fulfill his destiny and learn about his past with his new friends. The film series has been highly acclaimed with its first two features being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature as well as numerous Annie Awards while the television series has won 11 Emmy Awards. The first three films were the most financially successful animated feature film for their years[1] and the second is the second biggest worldwide box office success for a film directed solely by a woman (Jennifer Yuh Nelson), after Wonder Woman. In addition, the film series is particularly popular in China as an outstanding Western emulation of the wuxia film genre.[2] Contents 1 Films 1.1 Kung Fu Panda (2008) 1.2 Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011) 1.3 Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016) 1.4 Future 2 Television series 2.1 Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness 2.2 Kung Fu Panda: The Paws of Destiny 3 Short films 3.1 Kung Fu Panda: Secrets of the Furious Five (2008) 3.2 Kung Fu Panda Holiday (2010) 3.3 Kung Fu Panda: Secrets of the Masters (2011) 3.4 Kung Fu Panda: Secrets of the Scroll (2016) 3.5 Panda Paws (2016) 4 Releases 4.1 Box office performance 4.2 Critical and public reception 4.3 Awards 5 Cast and characters 6 Crew 7 Video games 8 Arena show 9 Attractions 10 See also 11 References 12 External links Films[edit] Kung Fu Panda (2008)[edit] Main article: Kung Fu Panda (film) Po, a clumsy panda, is a kung fu fanatic who lives in the Valley of Peace and works in his goose father Mr. Ping's noodle shop, unable to realize his dream of learning kung fu. One day, a kung fu tournament is held for the elderly spiritual leader of the valley, Grand Master Oogway, to determine the identity of the Dragon Warrior, the one kung fu master capable of understanding the secret of the Dragon Scroll, which is said to contain the key to limitless power. Everyone in the valley expects the Dragon Warrior to be one of the Furious Five—Tigress, Monkey, Mantis, Viper, and Crane—a quintet of kung fu warriors trained by Master Shifu to protect the valley. To everyone's surprise, Oogway chooses Po, who had accidentally stumbled into the tournament arena after arriving late via fireworks explosion. Refusing to believe that Po can be the Dragon Warrior, Shifu subjects Po to torturous training exercises in order to discourage him into quitting. Determined to change himself into someone he can respect, Po perseveres in his training and befriends the Furious Five, who had previously mocked Po for his lack of skill in kung fu. Po soon learns that Tai Lung is approaching the Valley, an evil kung fu warrior who has escaped from prison to take revenge for being denied the Dragon Scroll, and despairs he will be unable to defeat him. However, Shifu discovers that Po is capable of martial arts when motivated by food, and successfully trains him to learn kung fu. After his training is complete, Po is given the Dragon Scroll, which he discovers to be blank. However, Po realizes that the key to limitless power lies within himself, allowing him to defeat Tai Lung and restore peace to the valley. Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011)[edit] Main article: Kung Fu Panda 2 Po now lives his dream as a kung fu master and protects the Valley of Peace alongside the Furious Five. However, he is thrown into internal conflict when he begins having flashbacks of his mother and learns from Mr. Ping that he was adopted as an infant. Shortly after, Po and the Five are sent on a mission to stop the evil peacock Lord Shen from using a newly developed weapon, the cannon, to conquer all of China and destroy kung fu tradition. Po remains tormented by thoughts of being abandoned by his real parents until he is guided by a wise old soothsayer to embrace his past, and remembers that his parents risked their lives to save him from Shen, who had set out to exterminate all pandas after learning of a prophecy that he would be defeated by "a warrior of black-and-white". Po achieves inner peace, which allows him to destroy Shen's new weapon, defeat Shen, and accept Mr. Ping as his father. However, during the last scene of the movie, it shows Po's biological father realizing his son is alive. Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016)[edit] Main article: Kung Fu Panda 3 Shortly after the events of the second film, Shifu relinquishes his duties as master of the Jade Palace to Po, claiming that the next step of his own apprenticeship is to oversee the Furious Five's training. While struggling with this new responsibility, Po rejoices upon reuniting with his biological father, Li, though Mr. Ping is less enthusiastic. However, news arrives that the spirit warrior General Kai has returned to the mortal realm and is 'collecting' Kung Fu masters from all over China, both living and dead, to serve in his army of Jade Zombies. Po and the others discover from a scroll left by Oogway that Kai can only be defeated by the power of Chi, a technique known only by the panda colonies; thus, Po and Li set to the secret Panda Valley in order to have Po learn it. Po eventually discovers, to his horror, that Li had deceived him, because the pandas have long forgotten about how to manipulate the Chi, and he just wanted to protect his son from Kai. Once making amends with both his adoptive and biological fathers, Po joins forces with Ping, Tigress, and the pandas to make a stand against Kai, all mastering the power of Chi in the process and using its power to destroy him for good. After returning to the Valley of Peace, Po spends his days spreading the teachings of Kung fu and Chi. Future[edit] DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg has said that it is possible that the series could see three more sequels after Kung Fu Panda 3, bringing it to a six-film series.[3] On January 13, 2016, Collider asked the filmmakers of Kung Fu Panda 3 about the possibility of a fourth film.[4] Co-director Jennifer Yuh Nelson said, "It’s one at a time. We want to make this a perfect jewel, and then we’ll see what happens after that."[4] Co-director Alessandro Carloni said, "With the sequels, we don’t want to try to have them feel open-ended. We want it to feel like a completed journey, and we feel this movie does. And then, if a fantastic story presents itself, great."[4] On August 2, 2018, when asked about any updates on Kung Fu Panda 4, Nelson replied that she did not know as she had always seen the series as a trilogy, but that she was open to the idea of a fourth installment as long as it focused on Po.[5] Television series[edit] Series Season Episodes Originally released First released Last released Network Legends of Awesomeness 1 26 September 19, 2011 (2011-09-19) April 5, 2012 (2012-04-05) Nickelodeon 2 26 April 6, 2012 (2012-04-06) June 21, 2013 (2013-06-21) 3 28 18 June 24, 2013 (2013-06-24) June 22, 2014 (2014-06-22) 10 February 15, 2016 (2016-02-15) June 29, 2016 (2016-06-29) Nicktoons The Paws of Destiny 1 26 13 November 16, 2018 (2018-11-16) Prime Video 13 July 4, 2019 (2019-07-04) Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness[edit] Main article: Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness is an animated television series based on the Kung Fu Panda film series, set between the first two films.
