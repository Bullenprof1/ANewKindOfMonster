Ghosthunting With... External links Most Haunted Infobox instructions (only shown in preview) Most Haunted is a British paranormal reality television series. It was first shown on Living TV between 2002 and 2010. However, it has since been revived on Really and online, via an official mobile app and YouTube Channel. Presented by Yvette Fielding, the programme investigates purported paranormal activity in a range of locations, mainly within the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The series was produced by Antix Productions. After 4 years of being off-air, Fielding and Karl Beattie, the producer of the programme, confirmed that following a successful online episode, Most Haunted would be returning to screens in August 2014, aired by Really. In July 2019, Karl announced that Really TV will no longer be broadcasting any new episodes of Most Haunted, however repeats of previous series on Really TV will continue to air occasionally on the channel. New Most Haunted episodes, live events and new extra content including outtakes and behind the scenes material will continue to be produced, and these will now air on the official Most Haunted YouTube channel, to an international audience. A new channel is being sought by Antix Productions to air the new series, however until this channel is found, all new material from Most Haunted will now be available on their YouTube channel.[3] Over 295 episodes of the programme have been broadcast to date.

In 2012, it was revealed that Antix Productions partnered with Lionsgate to redevelop Most Haunted.[4] In July 2013, Karl Beattie began scouting new locations for a new series of Most Haunted.[citation needed] In April 2014 Yvette Fielding confirmed in an interview with Channel 4's Sunday Brunch that Most Haunted would be returning to television in late 2014; this was later confirmed on 4 June 2014. It was later confirmed that Really would be the new home of Most Haunted. Really ended their partnership with Most Haunted in the summer of 2019, with the new owners of Really, Discovery, Inc. deciding to concentrate on imported American paranormal programming, rather than the British-based Most Haunted. Production[edit] The Most Haunted team have travelled in the United Kingdom but also Ireland, the Netherlands, Romania, the United States, Italy, and Czech Republic, investigating paranormal activity for 24 hours at a time.

(July 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Presenter Yvette Fielding during filming on Series one The photographic style of the series has changed considerably since series 1. In the first series many elaborate shots were set up with an almost "theatrical" style, with illuminated windows and dry ice. Locations were often illuminated outside at night time, with blue and green colours. There was a high emphasis on quality production. From series 1–3 there was extensive use of the steadicam, which provided gliding shots during Yvette's ghostly tales or for general views. In series 8 the team introduced a camera crane or 'jib' system for elaborate aerial shots of both Yvette and the locations. Most of the photography in Most Haunted focuses on 'general views' also known as 'GV's' of a location and its surroundings. Most Haunted was filmed with both broadcast Sony DSR-570WSP & DSR-PD170P DVCAM cameras and Sony DCR-PC9E miniDV cameras. A thermal imaging camera was also used to detect and highlight cold and warm spots. The style of the series changed somewhat after series five, losing its Most Haunted grungy look as it became more mainstream. Music[edit] Most Haunted's music was originally composed to picture by Alan Clark, using his own original sounds and samples and including some from the Spectrasonics sample libraries Distorted Reality, Metamorphosis and Biazzare Guitar. As of series 12, Alan Clark's music has been supplemented with additional stock music which was also used on the now defunct Unexplained Channel programme, Rest in Peace. Living TV also released a CD featuring Alan Clark's music remixed and original material written and produced by composer and producer Steve Deakin-Davies (The Official Most Haunted soundtrack Vol 1 The Ambition Company/Solo MH104)[5] On-screen team[edit] This section does not cite any sources.

(January 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Between series 1 and series 15, Most Haunted featured a main presenter, a historian, a psychic medium and a parapsychologist. Essentially the latter two are intended to create an even balance between paranormal and scientific explanations for the various phenomena that occur. Any information provided by the medium from claimed interactions with spirits is then analysed by the historian to see if it can be verified. The core investigation team are supported by some of the production crew, who appear in the show and are generally involved with the investigation whilst performing their normal crew role. Most of these on-screen crew members also take part in séances. From series 16, Antix Productions decided to remove psychic mediums from the format of the show.

Each episode had a duration of thirty minutes. However, reruns of these episodes have been re-edited to the full hour and titled Most Haunted Unseen. Added footage in these episodes is shown with a caption in the corner to distinguish it from the original version. The series concluded with an investigation of Michelham Priory on 17 September 2002, which was coincidentally the first episode to be produced. In the eighth series the team revisited this location to mark the 100th episode. During the break in series, the team aired three live investigations, the third of which led into the second series on 8 April 2003. From this point onwards episodes were accompanied by a supplemental Most Haunted Extra. At this point, Extra was available as a ten-minute feature after the main show, accessible to viewers via the red button. For Series two and three, Phil Whyman joined the show as a paranormal investigator, replacing the original investigator Jason Karl of Lancashire as well as guest investigators Portsmouth native David Scanlan and Vicki Purewal who decided not to continue with the team, who left at the end of the first series. The show remained unchanged at this point until Series 4. Series 4–6 (Derek Acorah Departure and Revamp)[edit] The fourth series commenced on 23 March 2004 with an investigation of Owlpen Manor. Most Haunted Extra became a thirty-minute programme, broadcast for half an hour after the main show on LivingTV. This series was the first series in which guest mediums joined the team during the investigations. This took some of the pressure off Derek Acorah who had been the only medium in the first three series. The main guest mediums involved during this series were Salisbury native Brian Shepherd, David Wells and Scunthorpe's Ian Lawman. Series five commenced on 14 September 2004. It was preceded by a 3 night Most Haunted Live! investigation advertised as a countdown to the series. Phil Whyman was replaced with (although he recently returned on the Live shows as a studio expert), then semi-regular, Ciarán O'Keeffe. Originally O'Keeffe viewed the footage recorded during the investigations and analysed it, putting forward his own views and opinions, which usually included suggestions as to other possible causes for the phenomena encountered. He shared this role with his colleague Matthew Smith who frequently attended the early Most Haunted Live events. Following the departure of Phil Whyman after Series 4, O'Keeffe began to join the team on location. Yvette's brother Rick Fielding also left the show at the end of Series 4. At the end of Series 5, Antix Productions began editing the series in-house at their own production offices. Prior to this, post-production had been completed at 422 Manchester. As a result, the series lost its original editor who had worked on Most Haunted since the first episode and all of the vintage film composite effects which resulted in a considerable change to the editing style and look of the programme. Derek Acorah in series 1 For series six, beginning on 22 March 2005 with an investigation of Bodmin Gaol, David Wells became one of the main mediums alongside Derek Acorah appearing in every episode. This was Derek Acorah's last Most Haunted series owing to the controversy he was involved in during its production which cast doubt on his ability to perform his role.[6] As such he did not appear in the final episode at Sinai House. The number of episodes for Series 6 was originally intended to be eighteen, with the last eleven being part of Series 7. Due to Acorah's departure, the series was extended. This was the first series in which the team conducted 24-hour investigations over in the USA. Acorah didn't return for the show's finale at Sinai House when David Wells was the main medium. Series 7–9 (Spin-Offs and Cast Changes)[edit] The seventh series began on 1 November 2005 yet only ran for six weeks, shortened from an intended nine. Two of the final three episodes (at Bamburgh Castle and Chambercombe Manor) were broadcast at the end of Series 8 and the last, at Spitbank Fort, was broadcast as special on Boxing Day 2006. Parapsychologist Louie Savva a regular on the Most Haunted Live! events joined the team for a few of the investigations in this series covering shows which O'Keeffe was unable to take part in. Series eight began on 27 June 2006 with the 100th investigation and a revisit to Michelham Priory. It marked the last appearance of Richard Felix as the resident historian. He was not replaced until the tenth series. This series featured guest mediums Gordon Smith, Ian Lawman, Ian Shillito of Braintree, Essex and Kevin Wade. An investigation of South Stack Lighthouse began the ninth series on 2 January 2007. Four episodes into the series, new episodes became known as New Most Haunted in television listings and on-screen. This is the last series of Most Haunted where Most Haunted Extra accompanied each episode. After the first few episodes, Extra was moved to Living2. Most Haunted Extra last appeared accompanying Most Haunted: Midsummer Murders. This was the last series to feature David Wells as a regular medium on the show. Series 10: Midsummer Murders[edit] The 10th series was given the tagline Midsummer Murders and was an eight-part series where Most Haunted investigators attempted to solve murder mysteries in normal English villages. It was hosted by Most Haunted historian Lesley Smith. The series commenced on a weekly broadcast from 19 June 2007 to 31 July 2007 and the team visited (in order of broadcast) Stoney Middleton, Nantwich, Castleton, Pluckley, Ruthin, Tutbury, Tarvin, and Bakewell. An episode, shot in Lymm Village, saw the team investigate a suspect of Jack the Ripper. This episode was not aired on television. Most Haunted: Midsummer Murders was never released on DVD. Series 11 (The New Investigator Years)[edit] The eleventh series of Most Haunted began on 19 February 2008 and came to a close at the end of April.[7] This series featured three psychic mediums: Johnnie Fiori, Nottingham native Barrie John and Brian Shepherd. Lesley Smith replaced Richard Felix as the resident historian on the recorded shows and travelled with the team to each location. The team were also joined by Scottish paranormal investigator Ryan O'Neill, a guest on episodes 1&2 of series 10 at Coalhouse Fort.[8] In the Coalhouse Fort episodes of the show, an American psychic joined the team and claimed to have encountered the spirits of a bespectacled old man and his "gawky" son in the museum of the fort, who had been responsible for compiling the collection. The team allegedly picked up the voice and moaning from the old man later in the night.[9] The psychic also claimed that there were spirits of animals in the fort, perhaps from horses who had been involved in its construction and claimed to have encountered the spirit of a pilot named Jeff and other air force men around the fort who had been there during World War I.[9] She also claimed that in one area of the fort she picked up macabre images of debauchery and sodomy where sexual favours were performed in return for food and money, also from World War I.[9] The team also apparently picked up countless examples of poltergeist activity in the fort with the unexplained throwing of stones, knocking and the occasional moaning, responses from taunts by the team for the ghosts to make their presence known.[9] Series 12, 13 (Most Haunted USA) & 14[edit] Alternating between series 12 and 13, Living broadcast on an episode from series 12 followed the following week with an episode from Season 13 also known as Most Haunted USA.[citation needed] Series 14 aired in 2010 featuring 10 episodes with the opening episode at Speke Hall.[citation needed] Series 15 (Final Series on Living)[edit] Series 15 started on 12 May 2010, with an investigation into Berkeley Castle and continue to show every Wednesday on Living at 22:00 BST. The series ended on Wednesday 21 July 2010. The series was made up of 10 episodes concluding with a two-parter at Weald & Downland Museum, Singleton, West Sussex. DVD - Exclusive DVD Episode, 2011 (Stand Alone Investigation)[edit] A new episode of Most Haunted was released exclusively to DVD on 12 December 2011. This investigation was based at The Rifles Museum in Salisbury, England No New Episodes (2011 - 2014)[edit] Most Haunted ended in 2010, with the showing of repeats by LivingTV ending in 2011. In 2010, Freeview channel Sky 3 (later Pick TV, now Pick) began showing the repeats. This continued until 2016. Following the initial axing by LivingTV, Karl Beattie began a fan campaign to get the show back on the air. Most Haunted returned with a Christmas DVD special from The Rifles Museum in Salisbury. Later, three episodes from The Royal Court Theatre, Bacup, England produced and aired initially online then sold to Really TV as a single episode.[citation needed]. Series 16 (Revival on Really, New Set Up. 2014)[edit] It was announced on 4 June, that Most Haunted would return to TV in August 2014 with a new 10 part series to air on the Freeview channel, Really. Yvette Fielding returned to the show along with Karl Beattie. Former team members Stuart Torevell and Fred Batt also returned.[10] Welsh heavy metal band Bullet for My Valentine appeared in an episode of the show. Yvette Fielding was interviewed on the James Whale Show, discussing the current show and her reasons for not using mediums in the new series of Most Haunted.[11] Series 16 Episode List The Royal Court Theatre, Bacup Newton House (Part 1 (Special Guest Bullet for My Valentine) Newton House (Part 2 (Special Guest Bullet for My Valentine) The Galleries of Justice Delapré Abbey (Special Guest England Rugby Team) The National Emergency Services Museum Ye Olde Kings Head, Chester Drakelow Tunnels Saltmarshe Hall (Part 1 Saltmarshe Hall (Part 2 Series 17 (Mid-2015)[edit] Most Haunted aired its 17th series from June to July 2015.

Most Haunted USA[edit] Most Haunted USA was an eight-part mini-series that aired on the American Travel Channel from 12 December 2008 to 30 January 2009. The series has also aired in the UK and includes the team's investigation at the famous Waverly Hills Sanitorium in Kentucky.[citation needed] It aired as part of Series 11 in the UK. Most Haunted: The Live Series[edit] In January 2010, Most Haunted returned for a spin-off of the live shows. These episodes differed from the previous live shows in that they were more like a series investigation, but broadcast live. The series was broadcast every Saturday night and ran for 8 weeks, with each episode lasting two hours. Most Haunted: Top Ten Scariest Moments[edit] Top Ten Scariest Moments was a part-mini series that consists of 10 45-minute episodes, that was broadcast on Really and is still available to watch through UKTV Play, Really's on demand service.[note 1] The series features Yvette recalling her scariest moments from past series. A slightly shortened edit of the episode from which that moment was from is then shown. Included in the online series was 10-minute discussion featuring Yvette and Glen Hunt, the resident sceptic, on "the elephant in the room" after the investigation at the Wentworth Woodhouse Stable Block as to whether the footage of the 'Wentworth Ghost' was faked. Controversy[edit] On several occasions the former Spiritualist medium Derek Acorah was supposedly possessed by an entity, sometimes evil or sometimes "lost and confused". Two such cases exposed Acorah. Before the filming, Acorah had been fed misinformation twice about the non-existent ghosts of Kreed Kafer and Rik Eedles by the show parapsychologist Ciarán O'Keeffe (under instruction from Karl Beattie, according to Bad Psychics website). During the investigations, later broadcast, Acorah presented the information as fact and even behaved as though being possessed by the fictional ghosts. O'Keeffe later revealed in the Daily Mirror that Kreed Kafer and Rik Eedles were anagrams of 'Derek Faker' and 'Derek Lies'.[6] Even though O'Keeffe exposed Acorah, the paper also claimed that O'Keeffe had exposed the rest of the Most Haunted team. O'Keeffe later reported that he had been grossly misquoted and misrepresented in the article, and produced a response outlining his version of the show based on his observations and findings, saying he had exposed Derek Acorah and not the entirety of Most Haunted. The show's presenter, Yvette Fielding, said in an interview that she believes it was a fake possession.[13] The show was reported in 2005 to Ofcom relating to Derek Acorah. Ofcom described the show as one "where techniques are used which mean the audience is not necessarily in full possession of the facts". Ofcom ruled that this was not fraud because Most Haunted is an entertainment show, not a legitimate investigation into the paranormal, and should not be taken seriously.[14] Although not mentioned by O'Keeffe, the Mirror article also brought into question unedited footage which appeared to show Yvette Fielding and Karl Beattie faking 'paranormal' occurrences such as ghostly bumps and knocks. Fielding denied these claims; Beattie did not comment.[6] Notes[edit] Note 1.^ Available on UKTV Play as of 25 March 2018 References[edit] ^ According to Karl Beattie.
