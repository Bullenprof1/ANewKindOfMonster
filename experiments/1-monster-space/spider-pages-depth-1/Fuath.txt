A "fua" of the river grabs hold of a human.—Illust. Willy Pogany. Colum, Padraic (1916). King of Ireland's son A fuath (Scottish Gaelic: fuath Scottish Gaelic pronunciation: [fuə]‘hate'; plural: fuathan; phonetic English: vough, vaugh) is a class of malevolent spirits in Scottish Highland folklore, especially water spirits. In Sutherland was the so-called Moulin na Vaugha/Fouadh, ‘Mill of the Fuath', haunted by the fuath and her son, the amormphous brollachan. The mill was along a stream off Loch Migdale, and belonged to the Dempster family (Skibo Castle) estate. A fuath once seen at this mill was a nose-less banshee with yellow hair wearing a green silk dress; in the story of its capture[a] it was tormented into submission by use of steel (awl, and more effectively by a sewing needle), but turned to a jellyfish-like mass when light was shone on it. A fuath on the estate farm had webbed feet. They sometimes reputedly intermarry with human beings (typically the female), whose offspring have developed a mane and tail.

F. Campbell characterized the fuath of Sutherland as a water spirit,[4] but it has been stressed by John Gregorson Campbell that the term designates a spectre or goblin more generally, not necessarily of aqueous nature or habitat.[5] Conflated description[edit] J. F. Campbell also conflated the traits of the fuath from different accounts in a generalized description of the fuath of Sutherland[b][4] and this has also fallen under criticism by the other Campbell.[5][c] Furthermore, J. F. Campbell ascribed the mane and tail to the fuath, though these traits had evidently developed in the human progeny of the Munroe family, to which there was attached a floating rumour that their ancestor had interbred with a fuath several generations back.[6][d] While it has been generalized that the fuath of the locality wears green,[4] "golden and silken gear" was worn by the weird woman seen plunging into the River Shin was seen by a (games)keeper of the Charlotte Dempster's family.[8] Tales[edit] "The Brollachan" (and several of its variants) from Sutherland were collected by Charlotte Dempster in 1859, and supplied to J. F. Campbell who printed it. the stories are set in spots within the Dempster family estate (otherwise known as Skibo)[9][10][e] The writer Charlotte is a relative (granddaughter of Harriet, the illegitimate daughter of the captain).[10] (1) J. F. Campbell ed. (1860) "The Brollachan" (Popular Tales II, Tale #37) ;[11] Charlotte Dempster ed. (1888年) "The Brolachan MacVaugh"[12](Sutherlandshire, Moulin na Gleannan "Mill of the Glenn")[f] Two redactions collected from the same storyteller.[g] The brollachan is the son of a fuath, as the latter title indicates.[h][13][2] The brollachan possesses eyes and mouth, but a shapeless mass of a body, and capable of speaking only two words/phrases, "Myself" and "Yourself" (mi-phrein and tu-phrein).[13][14][i] The brollachan was lying at the mill when the "Allay na Moulin" Murray, the resident alms-receiving crippled man around the mill came and stoked the fire with peat, causing burns on him. But due to the limits of his vocabulary, the blob could not properly speak the name of the perpetrator[j]。 (2) J. F. Campbell ed. (1860) "Moulion na Fuadh" ;[15] Dempster ed. (1888) "The Vaugh of Moulinna Vuagha"[13](Sutherland, same mill as above. A man who lives in Inveran wagers he can go and capture the "kelpie" of the mill (also called the vough, vaugh) and return. He succeeds thanks to a black-muzzled dog, and bound the kelpie to a second horse. When fording the burn at the far end (south) of Loch Migdale the vough grew agitating, and the man poked it with an awl and a sewing needle into submission. The creature declared the needle was worse. Upon arrival, when the others shone light at it, it fell down, a shapeless jelly-like clump, which was much like the so-called "dropped stars" of the moors, strange objects like beached jellyfish. (3) J. F. Campbell ed. (1860), untitled variant;[16] Dempster ed. (1888) "The Banshee, or Vaugh, or Weird Woman of the Water"[9](Sutherland, same mill as above. [k] At the mill haunted by the brollachan, a banshee was spotted who had yellow hair like ripened wheat, wearing a fine silk green dress, but she had no nose. (4) J. F. Campbell ed. (1860), untitled variant;[17] Dempster ed. (1888) "The Web-footed Kelpie"[8](Sutherland, Dempster family sheep farm. [l] The (family's) shepherd found a dirty and lamed banshee and piggybacked her, until he noticed her webbed feet, throwing her off and flinging away the plaid she lay on. Fuath tribe members[edit] Below are the supposed "subspecies" of the fuath class, according to certain commentators.[18] peallaidh[1][2][3] fideal[2][3] beithir, in modern oral tradition[3]） ùruisg, or at least many of them[19][m][2][3] shellycoat[3][2] nuckelavee[m][2] Similar beings[edit] Similarity or equivalence to the bean nighe or Northern Ireland's uisges have been noted.[citation needed] In popular culture[edit] In ''Iron Kissed'' by Patricia Briggs, Mercy encounters The Fideal which is a fuath from Scottish folklore. In the book, it is an evil fresh water creature which is extremely large and covered in seaweed-like plants. It feasts of human flesh. “It used to live in a bog and eat straying children.“ This phrase is said by Samuel to Mercy afterwards. Explanatory notes[edit] ^ Where the fuath is called a "kelpie" ^ The traits are already enumerated above, in the leading paragraph. ^ Although the main tale and many of the variants he conflates are set in the same mill, as explained below ^ Carol Rose's amalgmation has confers a "long spikey tail" on the fuath, emerging from the green robe.[7] ^ As mentioned in another variant, where it is explained that "from Skibo there is a lake.. Migdall.. at one end a burn runs out past Moulinna Vaugha, or the kelpie's mill".[9] ^ The same mill also is known as Moulin na Vaugha "Mill of the Fuath" according to the variant tale below about the capture, Campbell's variant 1 (Dempster's vii).[13] This mill was within (or at least near) the expansion to the estate purchased by Captain John Hamilton Dempster, and on the purchased land's survey map the mill is labeled with the sprite's name spelt "fouah".[13] ^ Marie Calder, aka Widow M. Calder ^ The fuath and vough(vaugh) spellings are interchangeably used. ^ Dempster concludes that the brollachan is the equivalent of the Manx glashan or brounie, and also equatable to the Boneless bug or goblin mentioned by Reginald Scot in Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584). ^ Briggs refers to this tale as a Nemo type,[2] where Nemo is Latin for "No One" , referring to the name ("Outis" in Greek) that Odysseus employed on the isle of the Cyclops. Cf. Campbell's variant/parallel 9 (p. 198). ^ Misspelt lake name in Campbell: "Nigdall", (recté Migdall), as confirmed in Dempster's redaction. ^ Though not specified, the Creich farm near mill is known for sheep-raising. ^ a b Briggs states "many at least of the urisks, and presumably nuckelavee".
