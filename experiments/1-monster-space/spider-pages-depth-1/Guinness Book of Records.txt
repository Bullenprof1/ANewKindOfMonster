The brainchild of Sir Hugh Beaver, the book was co-founded by twin brothers Norris and Ross McWhirter in Fleet Street, London, in August 1954. As of the 2021 edition, it is now in its 66th year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages, and maintains over 53,000 records in its database. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in Guinness World Records becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records.[3][4] The organisation employs record adjudicators to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records.[5] Contents 1 History 2 Evolution 3 Defining records 3.1 Ethical and safety issues 3.2 Difficulty in defining records 4 Change in business model 5 Museums 6 Television series 7 Gamer's edition 8 The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles 9 Other media and products 9.1 Board game 9.2 Video games 9.3 Film 10 References 11 External links History[edit] On 10 November 1951, Sir Hugh Beaver, then the managing director of the Guinness Breweries,[6] went on a shooting party in the North Slob, by the River Slaney in County Wexford, Ireland. After missing a shot at a golden plover, he became involved in an argument over which was the fastest game bird in Europe, the golden plover or the red grouse – it is the plover.[7] That evening at Castlebridge House, he realised that it was impossible to confirm in reference books whether or not the golden plover was Europe's fastest game bird.[8][9] Beaver knew that there must have been numerous other questions debated nightly in pubs throughout Ireland and abroad, but there was no book in the world with which to settle arguments about records. He realised then that a book supplying the answers to this sort of question might prove successful.[10] Beaver's idea became reality when Guinness employee Christopher Chataway recommended university friends Norris and Ross McWhirter, who had been running a fact-finding agency in London. The twin brothers were commissioned to compile what became The Guinness Book of Records, in August 1954. A thousand copies were printed and given away.[11] After the founding of The Guinness Book of Records office at 107 Fleet Street, London, the first 198-page edition was bound on 27 August 1955 and went to the top of the British best seller lists by Christmas. The following year, it launched in the US, and sold 70,000 copies. Since then, Guinness World Records has sold more than 100 million copies in 100 countries and 37 languages.[12] Japanese competitive eater Takeru Kobayashi with two Guinness World Record certificates The North Beach (Nazaré, Portugal) listed on the Guinness World Records for the biggest waves ever surfed. Because the book became a surprise hit, many further editions were printed, eventually settling into a pattern of one revision a year, published in September/October, in time for Christmas. The McWhirters continued to compile it for many years. Both brothers had an encyclopedic memory; on the TV series Record Breakers, based upon the book, they would take questions posed by children in the audience on various world records and were able to give the correct answer. Ross McWhirter was assassinated by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1975.[13] Following Ross's assassination, the feature in the show where questions about records posed by children were answered was called Norris on the Spot. Guinness Superlatives, later Guinness World Records Limited, was formed in 1954 to publish the first book. Sterling Publishing owned the rights to the Guinness book in the US for decades. The group was owned by Guinness PLC and subsequently Diageo until 2001, when it was purchased by Gullane Entertainment for $65 million.[14] Gullane was itself purchased by HIT Entertainment in 2002. In 2006, Apax Partners purchased HIT and subsequently sold Guinness World Records in early 2008 to the Jim Pattison Group, the parent company of Ripley Entertainment, which is licensed to operate Guinness World Records' Attractions. With offices in New York City and Tokyo, Guinness World Records' global headquarters remain in London, while its museum attractions are based at Ripley headquarters in Orlando, Florida, US. Evolution[edit] Lucky Diamond Rich is "the world's most tattooed person", and has tattoos covering his entire body. He holds the Guinness World Records title as of 2006[update]. Recent editions have focused on record feats by person competitors. Competitions range from obvious ones such as Olympic weightlifting to the longest egg tossing distances, or for longest time spent playing Grand Theft Auto IV or the number of hot dogs that can be consumed in three minutes.[15] Besides records about competitions, it contains such facts such as the heaviest tumour,[16] the most poisonous fungus,[17] the longest-running soap opera[18] and the most valuable life-insurance policy,[19] among others. Many records also relate to the youngest people to have achieved something, such as the youngest person to visit all nations of the world; it is Maurizio Giuliano.[20] Each edition contains a selection of the records from the Guinness World Records database, as well as select new records, with the criteria for inclusion changing from year to year.[21] The retirement of Norris McWhirter from his consulting role in 1995 and the subsequent decision by Diageo Plc to sell The Guinness Book of Records brand have shifted the focus of the books from text-oriented to illustrated reference. A selection of records are curated for the book from the full archive but all existing Guinness World Records titles can be accessed by creating a login on the company's website. Applications made by individuals for existing record categories are free of charge. There is an administration fee of $5 to propose a new record title.[22] A number of spin-off books[23] and television series have also been produced. Guinness World Records bestowed the record of "Person with the most records" on Ashrita Furman of Queens, NY, in April 2009; at that time, he held 100 records and currently holds over 220.[24] In 2005, Guinness designated 9 November as International Guinness World Records Day to encourage breaking of world records.[25] In 2006, an estimated 100,000 people participated in over 10 countries. Guinness reported 2,244 new records in 12 months, which was a 173% increase over the previous year.[25] In February 2008, NBC aired The Top 100 Guinness World Records of All Time and Guinness World Records made the complete list available on their website.[26] Defining records[edit] Sultan Kösen (Turkey) is the tallest living person since 17 September 2009, as verified by Guinness World Records. Chandra Bahadur Dangi (Nepal) recognised as world shortest man ever by Guinness World Records Play media Cracking open a wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese as a part of a 2013 world record by Whole Foods Market.[27] Fiann Paul, Alex Gregory and Carlo Facchino aboard Polar Row, the most record breaking expedition in history.[28] For many records, Guinness World Records is the effective authority on the exact requirements for them and with whom records reside, the company providing adjudicators to events to determine the veracity of record attempts. The list of records which the Guinness World Records covers is not fixed, records may be added and also removed for various reasons. The public are invited to submit applications for records, which can be either the bettering of existing records or substantial achievements which could constitute a new record.[5] The company also provides corporate services for companies to "harness the power of record-breaking to deliver tangible success for their businesses."[29] Ethical and safety issues[edit] Steven Petrosino drinking 1 litre of beer in 1.3 seconds in June 1977.[30][31] Petrosino set record times for 250 ml, 500 ml and 1.5 litres as well, but Guinness accepted only the record for one litre. They later dropped all alcohol records from their compendium in 1991, then reinstated the records in 2008. Guinness World Records states several types of records it will not accept for ethical reasons, such as those related to the killing or harming of animals.[32] Several world records that were once included in the book have been removed for ethical reasons, including concerns for the well-being of potential record breakers. For example, following publication of the "heaviest fish" record, many fish owners overfed their pets beyond the bounds of what was healthy, and therefore such entries were removed.[citation needed] The Guinness Book also dropped records within their "eating and drinking records" section of Human Achievements in 1991 over concerns that potential competitors could harm themselves and expose the publisher to potential litigation.[33] These changes included the removal of all spirit, wine and beer drinking records, along with other unusual records for consuming such unlikely things as bicycles and trees.[33] Other records, such as sword swallowing and rally driving (on public roads), were closed from further entry as the current holders had performed beyond what are considered safe human tolerance levels. There have been instances of closed categories being reopened. For example, the sword swallowing category was listed as closed in the 1990 Guinness Book of World Records, but has since been reopened with Johnny Strange breaking a sword swallowing record on Guinness World Records Live.[34][35] Similarly, the speed beer drinking records which were dropped from the book in 1991, reappeared 17 years later in the 2008 edition, but were moved from the "Human Achievements" section of the older book[36] to the "Modern Society" section of the newer edition.[37] As of 2011[update], it is required in the guidelines of all "large food" type records that the item be fully edible, and distributed to the public for consumption, to prevent food wastage.[5] Chain letters are also not allowed: "Guinness World Records does not accept any records relating to chain letters, sent by post or e-mail."[citation needed] At the request of the U.S. Mint, in 1984, the book stopped accepting claims of large hoardings of pennies or other currency.[38] Difficulty in defining records[edit] For some potential categories, Guinness World Records has declined to list some records that are too difficult or impossible to determine. For example, its website states: "We do not accept any claims for beauty as it is not objectively measurable."[32] An example of this was the record for the Worlds Fastest Violinist, which was suspended as the Guinness World Records released a statement about this on one of the records on their YouTube Channel, due to pressure from YouTube personalities Brett Yang and Eddy Chen, who are the heads of the channel Twoset Violin. Guinness World Records stated that they could not determine if the Violinist in question was playing the notes correctly, and other attributes, such as clearness and articulation.[39] However, other categories of human skill relating to measurable speed such as "Worlds Fastest Clapper" were instated. On 27 July 2010, Connor May (NSW, Australia) set the record for 743 claps in 1 minute. On 10 December 2010, Guinness World Records stopped its new "dreadlock" category after investigation of its first and only female title holder, Asha Mandela, determining it was impossible to judge this record accurately.[40] Change in business model[edit] Traditionally, the company made a large amount of its revenue via book sales to interested readers, especially children. The rise of the Internet began to cut into book sales in the 2000s and forward, part of a general decline in the book industry. According to a 2017 story by Planet Money of NPR, Guinness began to realise that a lucrative new revenue source to replace falling book sales was the would-be record-holders themselves.[41] While any person can theoretically send in a record to be verified for free, the process is slow and manual for this. Would-be record breakers that paid fees ranging from US$12,000 to US$500,000 would be given advisors, adjudicators, help in finding good records to break as well as suggestions for how to do it, prompt service, and so on. In particular, corporations and celebrities seeking a publicity stunt to launch a new product or draw attention to themselves began to hire Guinness World Records, paying them for finding a record to break or to create a new category just for them.[41] Guinness World Records was criticised by television talk show host John Oliver on the program Last Week Tonight with John Oliver in August 2019.[42] Oliver pointed serious criticism at Guinness for taking money from authoritarian governments for pointless vanity projects as it related to the main focus of his story, President of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow.[42] Oliver asked for Guinness to work with Last Week Tonight to adjudicate a record for "Largest cake featuring a picture of someone falling off a horse," but according to Oliver, the offer did not work out after Guinness insisted on a non-disparagement clause. Guinness World Records denied the accusations and stated that they declined Oliver's offer to participate because "it was merely an opportunity to mock one of our record-holders," and that Oliver did not specifically request the record for the largest marble cake.[43] As of 2021, the Guinness World Record for "Largest marble cake" remains with Betty Crocker Middle East, set in Saudi Arabia.[44] Museums[edit] Guinness Museum in Hollywood In 1976, a Guinness Book of World Records museum opened in the Empire State Building. Speed shooter Bob Munden then went on tour promoting The Guinness Book of World Records by performing his record fast draws with a standard weight single-action revolver from a Western movie-type holster. His fastest time for a draw was 0.02 seconds.[45] Among exhibits were life-size statues of the world's tallest man, Robert Wadlow, and world's largest earthworm, an X-ray photo of a sword swallower, repeated lightning strike victim Roy Sullivan's hat complete with lightning holes and a pair of gem-studded golf shoes on sale for $6,500.[46] The museum closed in 1995.[47] In more recent years, the Guinness company has permitted the franchising of small museums with displays based on the book, all currently (as of 2010[update]) located in towns popular with tourists: Tokyo, Copenhagen, San Antonio. There were once Guinness World Records museums and exhibitions at the London Trocadero, Bangalore, San Francisco, Myrtle Beach, Orlando,[48] Atlantic City, New Jersey,[49] and Las Vegas, Nevada.[50] The Orlando museum, which closed in 2002, was branded The Guinness Records Experience;[48] the Hollywood, Niagara Falls, Copenhagen, and Gatlinburg, Tennessee museums also previously featured this branding.[50] Television series[edit] Guinness World Records has commissioned various television series documenting world record breaking attempts, including: Country Name Network Broadcast Host(s) Arab World العرب في موسوعة جينيس Arabs in the Guinness Book of Records Al Dar 1 2021 Turki Al Omari George Kurdahi Australia Australia's Guinness World Records Seven Network 2005 Grant Denyer Shelley Craft Australia Smashes Guinness World Records 2010 James Kerley Bulgaria Световните рекорди Гинес bTV 2006–2007 Krasimir Vankov China The day of Guinness in China CCTV 2006– Wang Xuechun Zhu Xun Lin Hai France L'émission des records (1999–2002) L'été des records (2001) TF1 1999–2002 Vincent Perrot L'été de tous les records (2003–2005) 50 ans, 50 records (2004) France 3 2003–2005 Pierre Sled La nuit des records France 2 2006 Olivier Minne Adriana Karembeu Le monde des records W9 2008–2010 Alexandre Devoise Karine Ferri Les trésors du livre des records Gulli 2015 Fauve Hautot Willy Rovelli Germany Guinness World Records - Die größten Weltrekorde RTL Television 2004–2008 Oliver Welke (2004) Oliver Geissen (2005–2008) Greece Guinness World Records Mega Channel 2009–2011 Katerina Stikoudi (2009–2010) Kostas Fragkolias (2009–2010) Giorgos Lianos (2010–2011) India Guinness World Records – Ab India Todega Colors TV 2011 Preity Zinta Shabbir Ahluwalia Italy Lo show dei record Canale 5 2006 (pilot) 2008–2012 2015 Barbara d'Urso (1–2) Paola Perego (3) Gerry Scotti (4, 6–7) Teo Mammucari (5) La notte dei record TV8 2018 Enrico Papi New Zealand NZ Smashes Guinness World Records TV2 2009 Marc Ellis Philippines Guinness Book of World Records Philippine Edition ABC 2004 Cookie Calabig Poland Światowe Rekordy Guinnessa Polsat 2009–2011 Maciej Dowbor Portugal Guinness World Records Portugal SIC 2014 Rita Andrade João Ricardo Spain El show de los récords Antena 3 2001–2002 Mar Saura Manu Carreño Mónica Martínez Guinness World Records Telecinco 2009 Carmen Alcayde Luis Alfonso Muñoz Sweden Guinness rekord-TV TV3 1999–2000 Mårten Andersson (1999) Linda Nyberg (1999) Harald Treutiger (2000) Suzanne Sjögren (2000) United Kingdom Record Breakers BBC1 1972–2001 Roy Castle (1972–1993) Norris McWhirter (1972–85) Ross McWhirter (1972–75) Guinness World Records (UK) ITV 1999–2001 Ian Wright Kate Charman Ultimate Guinness World Records Challenge 2004 Jamie Rickers Guinness World Records Smashed Sky1 2008–2009 Steve Jones Konnie Huq Totally Bonkers Guinness Book of Records ITV2 2012–2015 Matt Edmondson Officially Amazing CBBC 2013–2018 Ben Shires United States The Guinness Game Syndicated 1979–1980 Bob Hilton Don Galloway Guinness World Records Primetime Fox 1998–2001 Cris Collinsworth Mark Thompson Guinness World Records Unleashed / Gone Wild truTV 2013–2014 Dan Cortese Specials: Guinness World Records: 50 Years, 50 Records - on ITV (UK), 11 September 2004 With the popularity of reality television, Guinness World Records began to market itself as the originator of the television genre, with slogans such as we wrote the book on Reality TV. Suresh Joachim Arulanantham is a Tamil Canadian film actor and producer and multiple-Guinness World Record holder who has broken over 50 world records set in several countries in attempts to benefit the underprivileged children around the world. Some world record attempts are more unusual than others: he is pictured here minutes away from breaking the ironing world record at 2 days, 7 hours and 5 minutes, at Shoppers World, Brampton. Gamer's edition[edit] Not to be confused with Guinness World Records: The Videogame. In 2008, Guinness World Records released its gamer's edition, a branch that keeps records for popular video game high scores, code and feats in association with Twin Galaxies. The Gamer's Edition contains 258 pages, over 1,236 video game related world records and four interviews including one with Twin Galaxies founder Walter Day. The most recent edition is the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2020, which was released 5 September 2019. The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles[edit] Main article: British Hit Singles & Albums The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles was a music reference book first published in 1977. It was compiled by BBC Radio 1 DJs Paul Gambaccini and Mike Read with brothers Tim Rice and Jonathan Rice. It was the first in a number of music reference books that were to be published by Guinness Publishing with sister publication The Guinness Book of British Hit Albums coming in 1983. After being sold to Hit Entertainment, the data concerning the Official Chart Company's singles and albums charts were combined under the title British Hit Singles & Albums, with Hit Entertainment publishing the book from 2003 to 2006 (under the Guinness World Records brand). After Guinness World Records was sold to The Jim Pattison Group, it was effectively replaced by a series of books published by Ebury Publishing/Random House with the Virgin Book of British Hit Singles first being published in 2007 and with a Hit Albums book following two years later.[51][52][53] Other media and products[edit] Board game[edit] In 1975, Parker Brothers marketed a board game, The Guinness Game of World Records, based on the book. Players compete by setting and breaking records for activities such as the longest streak of rolling dice before rolling doubles, stacking plastic pieces, and bouncing a ball off alternating sides of a card, as well as answering trivia questions based on the listings in the Guinness Book of World Records. Video games[edit] A video game, Guinness World Records: The Video Game, was developed by TT Fusion and released for Nintendo DS, Wii and iOS in November 2008. Film[edit] In 2012, Warner Bros. announced the development of a live-action film version of Guinness World Records with Daniel Chun as scriptwriter. The film version will apparently use the heroic achievements of record holders as the basis for a narrative that should have global appeal.[54] References[edit] ^ "Corporate". Guinness World Records.
