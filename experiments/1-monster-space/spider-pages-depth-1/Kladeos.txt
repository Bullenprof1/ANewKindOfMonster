The river Kladeos flows through Olympia in Elis, southern Greece, and empties into the river Alfeios. Already in classical antiquity, the river was diverted near Olympia in order to prevent flooding in winter. However, the sanctuary of Olympia was covered by a 4 m thick layer of sediment when it was excavated in 1875. References[edit] ^ Woodard, Roger (2007). The Cambridge Companion to Greek Mythology.
