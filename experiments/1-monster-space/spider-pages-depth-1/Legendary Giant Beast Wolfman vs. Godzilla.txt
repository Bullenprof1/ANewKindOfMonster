Contents 1 Production 2 Release 3 References 4 External links Production[edit] Director Shizuo Nakajima conceived the idea for the film during his employment with Toho as a production assistant. He envisioned it as a feature-length film with human drama and location shots and as a love-letter to Eiji Tsuburaya's works, however, Nakajima also drew inspiration from The Curse of the Werewolf. The team purchased materials directly from Toho and built miniature industrial factories, buildings, and a replica of the 1964 Godzilla suit. Using former Toho employees, principal photography began in 1983 and wrapped in the mid-80s, with 10 hours of raw footage completed. The film was shot on 8 mm film. Post-production has been active since the mid-80s and is currently[when?] continuing on the film.[1] Release[edit] The film has remained unreleased due to litigation from Toho (owners of Godzilla) for the unauthorized use of Godzilla.[2] References[edit] ^ a b Mark Jaramillo (June 2, 2013).
