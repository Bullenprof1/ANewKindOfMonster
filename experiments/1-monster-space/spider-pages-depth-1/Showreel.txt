Play media An example of a cinematography showreel A showreel (also known as a demo reel or sizzle reel) is a short video showcasing a person's previous work used by many kinds of people involved in filmmaking and other media, including actors, animators, lighting designers, editors, and models. Usually 2 to 3 minutes in length and consisting of footage from different projects, a showreel typically supplements a résumé and is used to promote the person to talent agents, producers, and casting directors.[1][2][3] A voice actor may create an audio-only showreel, referred to as a voice reel, for the same purpose. Outside of the entertainment industry, companies use showreels for brand management and other forms of marketing communications and public relations, which in this case is called a corporate showreel.[4] Edited montages used for public relations, advertising, or propaganda of various kinds are also called "showreels" or "sizzle reels".[5][6] See also[edit] Artist's portfolio References[edit] ^ Piper, Stuart (30 September 2014).
