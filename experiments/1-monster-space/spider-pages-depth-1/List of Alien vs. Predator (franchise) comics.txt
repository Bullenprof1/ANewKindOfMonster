Aliens vs. Predator Cover of the trade paperback of the original Aliens versus Predator comic series. Publication information Publisher Dark Horse Comics Marvel Comics Formats Original material for the series has been published as a strip in the comics anthology(s) Dark Horse Presents and a set of limited series and graphic novels. Genre Horror Publication date Dark Horse: 1989–2020 Marvel: 2021– Aliens. Predator (also known as Aliens versus Predator, abbreviated AVP) is a comic book series published by Dark Horse Comics between 1989 and 2020 on an intermittent basis, written and drawn by various artists. Dark Horse also publishes the Aliens and Predator lines of comics. AVP is part of the crossover franchise originated and published by Dark Horse Comics. According to the notes which accompany the first Aliens versus Predator graphic novel, the original idea of combining the Aliens with Predators was the result of a late 1980s brain-storming session between the comic's creators (AVP artist and editor Chris Warner is specifically credited). Eventually, a film, Alien vs. Predator, was made in 2004, with a sequel in 2007 (called Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem) including a hybrid of a Xenomorph and a Predator. However, the films did not follow either the settings or the stories of the original comic series.

The settlers on Ryushi raise cattle-like quadrupedal ungulates called rhynth for export to other solar systems, and at the time of the story are in the process of assembling a shipment of the native livestock. Unbeknownst to the colonists, Ryushi is a traditional hunting ground of the Predators, and they are returning for their initiation rites. On board the Predator ship, the prey are prepared: an Alien queen lays eggs for delivery to Ryushi. Confounding the Predator's safeguards, this queen manages to slip an egg containing the seed of another queen into the shipment. On reaching Ryushi, the eggs hatch and infect Rhynths. Led by a Predator elder, "Broken Tusk", the Predators arrive expecting to encounter Aliens. However, they soon encounter the settlers and, after Broken Tusk is incapacitated, change their plans to hunt them instead. Meanwhile, the infected Rhynth have been loaded aboard a cargo transporter and, with a queen among their number, an Alien colony quickly takes hold. The Predator assault continues to the settler colony itself, and the surviving settlers find themselves pitched between the Aliens and Predators. Broken Tusk, now recovered due to the intervention of a human doctor, sides with Machiko, and together with the cargo ship's crew they arrange for the transporter's massive orbiter to crash into Ryushi and destroy the colony and the Aliens. In the ensuing fight, Broken Tusk is mortally wounded, but, admiring the courage of his human comrade, "bloods" Machiko with the mark of his clan. The story concludes with Machiko the sole inhabitant of Ryushi, the surviving settlers having been evacuated from the planet. She awaits, and is rewarded with, the return of the Predators and another hunt. One of Broken Tusk's former Predator rivals greets her and, recognizing Broken Tusk's clan symbol, accepts Machiko into the hunt.
