Contents 1 Gameplay 2 Plot 3 Reception 4 References 5 External links Gameplay[edit] The player plays as one of several giant monsters (twelve playable characters: Anguirus, Destoroyah, Gigan, Godzilla 90s, Godzilla 2000, King Ghidorah, Mecha-King Ghidorah, Megalon, Orga, Rodan, and Mechagodzilla). The player must defeat their opponents via punches, kicks, and limb attacks (usually a tail-attack). Each monster can use their signature beam attack and throw environmental objects. Army forces (missile and freeze tanks) and the monster Hedorah (which slows a monster's energy regeneration) are also present and sporadically attack all monsters. Extras include powerup orbs, which provide additional health, energy, unlock a finishing move, or summon Mothra for an airstrike. Extra features include choice of several locations, and a "destruction" mode (in which players compete to destroy buildings in a city) and "melee" mode (in which up to four players can compete simultaneously). Plot[edit] The plot involves an alien race known as the Vortaak invading the Earth and assuming control of the planet's giant monsters, sending them to attack cities across the globe. One monster breaks free from the Vortaak's control, and battles the other monsters in order to drive off the Vortaak, and that monster is the king of the monsters, Godzilla.
