It captures Minilla and a Kamacuras in its web, killing the latter with its stinger. However, Godzilla arrives and defeats the monstrous spider with Minilla's help, who incinerate Kumonga with their atomic breath. As of the film Destroy All Monsters, a second Kumonga was relocated to Monsterland, where it lives Earth's other remaining monsters. They are captured and brainwashed by the alien Kilaaks, who send them to attack Earth's major cities. After a group of human astronauts destroy the Kilaaks' control device, the Earth monsters converge on the aliens' Earth outpost. They summon King Ghidorah to defend them, but Earth's monsters join forces to kill the space dragon before returning to Monsterland to live in peace. The Showa Kumonga was 45 meters (150 feet) tall and weighed 8,000 metric tons (8,818 short tons).[1] Millennium[edit] Kumonga appears in the 2004 film Godzilla: Final Wars as one of many mind-controlled monsters used by the Xiliens. After a group of humans free Godzilla from Antarctica to stop them, the Xiliens dispatch Kumonga to New Guinea to battle Godzilla. The arachnid initially outmaneuvers and entangles its opponent in its thick webbing, but Godzilla uses the webbing to throw Kumonga across the horizon. The Final Wars Kumonga was 60 meters (196 feet) tall, and weighed 30,000 metric tons (33,069b short tons).[2] Abilities[edit] The Showa Kumonga can spit webbing and deploy a venomous stinger from its mouth while the Millennium incarnation can jump and spit webbing that can transform into canvas nets.
