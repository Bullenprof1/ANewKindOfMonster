These films were made in conjunction with Ryo Takei's company Sogei Pro.[3] According to Honda, the film was made at a time when Toho was "trying everything out" which led to building a film around Chiyoko Shimakura.[4] Honda commented later on the era saying he "tried [his] best at whatever kind of thing would come my way instead of rejecting something that might not have been for me."[4] Release[edit] Tōkyō no hito sayōnara was distributed theatrically by Toho on 28 June 1956.[1] References[edit] ^ a b c d e f Galbraith IV 2008, p. 123. sfn error: no target: CITEREFGalbraith_IV2008 (help) ^ Ryfle & Godziszewski 2017, p. 124. sfn error: no target: CITEREFRyfleGodziszewski2017 (help) ^ Ryfle & Godziszewski 2017, p. 123. sfn error: no target: CITEREFRyfleGodziszewski2017 (help) ^ a b Ryfle & Godziszewski 2017, p. 125. sfn error: no target: CITEREFRyfleGodziszewski2017 (help) Bibliography[edit] Galbraith IV, Stuart (2008).
