Homonoia[pronunciation?] (Greek: Ὁμόνοια), in ancient Greek religion, was a minor goddess of concord, unanimity, and oneness of mind.[1] Her opposite number was Eris (Strife).[1] Homonoia was believed to be the daughter of Soter, the saviour daimon, and Praxidike, the goddess of judicial punishment and vengeance. Her siblings were Arete (a goddess personifying virtue) and Ktesios, minor god of household. Arete and Homonoia were referred to as the Praxidikai, taking this name after their mother.[2] As such Homonoia was probably closely identified with the Theban Goddess-Queen Harmonia.
