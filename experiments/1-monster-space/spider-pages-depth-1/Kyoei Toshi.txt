The player chooses between either playing as a man called Ken Misaki or a woman called Miharu Matsuhara (the character may be renamed), with the objective being to try to escape the city with their partner Yuki. Early on, the main character witnesses a deal between yakuza, which results in them having to escape from a hitman constantly chasing them throughout the game as well. The escape leads the main character and Yuki around the city, and they learn more about Yuki's past and her connection to the giant shadows.[1] Cast[edit] Takuya Sato as Ken Misaki[1] Satomi Akesaka as Miharu Matsubara[1] Reina Ueda as Yuki Kouno[1] Ryota Takeuchi as Hideyasu Otsuka[1] Yuko Kaida as Lisa Kashiwagi[1] Minoru Kawai as Ryoji Shibata[1] Toru Nara as Katsuhiro Muto[1] Madoka Shiga as Toru Fujiwara[1] Giant Shadows[edit] The main point of this game is to survive the giant monsters or mechas encountered in the 17 levels of the game.
