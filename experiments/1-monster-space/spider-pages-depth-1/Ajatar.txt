Or both. Aika and ajaa might be etymologically connected through the sense of time, like death, hunting oneself. In other media[edit] Derivative works[edit] Although Ajatar does not appear by name in documented Finnish folk songs, she appears in fiction inspired by the Kalevala and in modern fantasy interpretations. In the second act of Aleksis Kivi’s play, Kullervo (1860),[8] Ajatar is described as ferocious and shameless,[9] encouraging the protagonist to kill his master’s family. Ajatar states that she lives in the mountains, has Lempo and Gnomes in her service,[10] and that her mother’s father is Hiisi. Ajatar is further described as “nasty”[11] and compared to a “vicious wife who rejoices in evils.”[12] In The Eye of Disparager: Book One of the Legend of the Bloodstone written by Brett Stuart Smith, Ajatar is a beautiful woman with the upper body of a green scaled woman and the lower half made up of many snakes. She has serpentine fangs and seductive eyes, and is the mother of all snakes.[13] Ajatar is mentioned twice in Matt Smith’s Big Game: Movie Tie-in Edition. Smith referred to her as “the Devil of the Woods who appeared as a dragon and made you sick if you so much as looked at her” and later associations a force of nature to her destructive powers.[14] Fantasy author, Philip Mazza, portrays the Ajatar as a race of fire breathing dragons, causing pestilence and disease.[15] In his book, The Harrow: From Under a Tree, Mazza describes two races of Ajatar, black and red, which fight amongst each other. One race, the black dragons, are evil whereas the red race are described as more benevolent.[16] In the novel Beneath The Mantle by Ahimsa Kerp, Ajatar is a secondary antagonist serving Ra, the Sun God. Christian references[edit] In some Finnish translations of The Bible the term ajatar is used to refer to certain demons or devils : In Leviticus [17.7] of the Finnish Bible (1776 ed., see also Bible translations into Finnish), a variation of Ajatar’s name (Ajattaroille = to the Ajattaras/Ajatars) appears to use her as a general devil or demon and not a separate entity. "Ja ei millään muotoa enää uhriansa uhraaman ajattaroille, joiden kanssa he huorin tehneet ovat. Se pitää oleman heille heidän sukukunnissansa ijankaikkinen sääty," Music[edit] Ajatar Rising by Epic North Music (2013). Ajatar by Winter Gardens (2011).
