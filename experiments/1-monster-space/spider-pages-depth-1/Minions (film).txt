After rolling a Tyrannosaurus into a volcano, getting their caveman leader eaten by a bear, crushing a Pharaoh under a pyramid after constructing it upside-down, exposing Count Dracula to sunlight, and accidentally firing a cannon at Napoleon while in Russia, the Minions are driven into isolation and start a new life in a massive cave. After many years, the Minions become depressed and unmotivated without a master to serve. To regain their dignity and sense of purpose, Kevin recruits Stuart and Bob, setting out to look for a new master. In 1968, the three journey to New York City, where they end up in a department store for the night, and accidentally discover a hidden commercial broadcast for villains advertising Villain-Con; a convention for all villains and supervillains in Orlando. The three eventually hitchhike a ride with the Nelson family and impress them with their accidental villainy after being chased by the police as a result of a robbery committed by the Nelsons. At the convention, they see Scarlet Overkill, an incredibly famous and popular female supervillain who unexpectedly hires them and takes them to her home in England. They phone the rest of the Minions to get them to join. Scarlet plans to steal the Imperial State Crown from Queen Elizabeth II and promises to reward the Minions if they steal it, and kill them if they do not. Her husband, Herb, supplies them with inventions to aid in the heist, but they are nearly caught when they break into the Tower of London. The chase leads to Bob accidentally crashing into the Sword in the Stone by pulling it free to defend himself and his friends, causing Bob to remove the Queen from the throne and becoming King Bob. Enraged that somebody else accomplished her dream of stealing the throne, Scarlet confronts the Minions, so Bob abdicates the throne in her favor. Undeterred, Scarlet imprisons the three in a dungeon before her coronation and Herb tortures the trio, but they escape with the intention to apologize to Scarlet. After making their way to Westminster Abbey, Stuart and Bob interrupt the coronation by inadvertently dropping a chandelier on Scarlet, who catches them, and orders their execution having survived. Dozens of villains chase them during a thunderstorm; Kevin goes into a pub, where the Queen hangs out. He sees Scarlet on a television, promising that she will kill Stuart and Bob if Kevin does not show up by dawn. With the villains still searching for him, Kevin sneaks into Scarlet's castle to steal weapons, and accidentally triggers a machine Herb was building and grows into a gigantic Minion, destroying the castle. Kevin tramples through London, rescues his friends and battles Scarlet just as the other Minions turn up in London. Scarlet tries to eradicate them by firing a massive missile, and Kevin swallows it. Scarlet and Herb attempt to escape with her rocket dress only for Kevin to hold onto it and get pulled into the sky. The missile finally explodes, seemingly killing Kevin, Scarlet, and Herb. As the Minions mourn the loss of their leader, Kevin survives and returns to his normal size. The Queen gets her throne and crown back. She rewards Bob with a tiny crown for his teddy bear, Stuart with an electric guitar (that he wrecks whilst playing), and Kevin with a knighthood. A young Gru flees with the crown on a rocket-powered motorbike, the Minions run after him, deciding he is the boss they were looking for.

(January 2021) Development[edit] Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment first announced in July 2012, that the Minions from the franchise would get their own spin-off film, scheduled for a 2014 release.[10] Brian Lynch was asked to write the film's screenplay, due to his prior work writing for the theme park ride Despicable Me Minion Mayhem.[11] Casting[edit] In February 2013, Sandra Bullock joined the cast to voice Scarlet Overkill,[5] with Jon Hamm joining two months later as her husband Herb Overkill.[6] In March 2015, Allison Janney was reported to cast as Madge Nelson.[8] Animation[edit] The film was foreshadowed in the mid-credits scene of Despicable Me 2 (2013), where Kevin, Stuart, and Bob, three of the Minions and the film's main characters, are seen auditioning for the film.[12][13] Music[edit] Minions: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Film score by Heitor Pereira Released July 10, 2015 Recorded 2015 Studio Twentieth Century Fox Newman Scoring Stage in Los Angeles, CA EastWest Studios in Los Angeles, CA Genre Score Length 67:11 Label Back Lot Music Heitor Pereira film scores chronology Curious George 3: Back to the Jungle (2015) Minions: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (2015) The Angry Birds Movie (2016) The official soundtrack for the film was released on July 10, 2015, by Back Lot Music.

The website's critical consensus reads, "The Minions' brightly colored brand of gibberish-fueled insanity stretches to feature length in their self-titled Despicable Me spinoff, with uneven but often hilarious results."[43] According to the review aggregator Metacritic, which sampled 35 reviews and calculated a weighted average of 56 out of 100, Minions received "mixed or average reviews".[44] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.[36] Jesse Hassenger of The A.V. Club gave the film a C, saying "Minions has idiosyncratic roots, but it's a franchise play all the way. Finally, even 5-year-olds have their own movie that mechanically cashes in on something they loved when they were younger".[45] Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying, "I, too, once enjoyed the Minions, in the small doses that they came in. But the extra-strength Minions is, for better or for worse, too much of a good thing".[46] Brian Truitt of USA Today gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying, "Brian Lynch's screenplay features a series of amusing sight gags and physical comedy that mostly hits; watching the Minions play polo while riding Corgis is an exercise in cuteness".[47] Tom Russo of The Boston Globe gave the film two stars out of four, saying, "Impressive as it is that the filmmakers get so much comedic mileage out of their characters' half-intelligible prattling, the conventional dialogue is bafflingly flat".[48] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said, "While Minions explores nominally new narrative ground, it folds neatly into a series that now includes two features, various shorts, books, video games, sheet music and a theme park attraction. So, you know, different but also the same".[49] Tom Long of The Detroit News gave the film a B, saying "Minions is every bit as cute as it's supposed to be, a happily empty-headed animated frolic that rarely pauses to take a breath".[50] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film two stars out of four, saying, "It's not whether this prequel can mint money; that's a given. The questions is: Can the minions carry a movie all by their mischievous mini-selves? 'Fraid not".[51] Kerry Lengel of The Arizona Republic gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, "Despite the dizzying pace of carefully calibrated incongruities, Minions somehow never generates more than the occasional chuckle".[52] Christopher Orr of The Atlantic said, "There's plenty of high-velocity comic inanity on display to keep kids happily diverted. But the movie's major flaw is an extension of its own premise: Search as they may, the minions never find a villain worthy of their subservience".[53] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave the film two stars out of four, saying, "With its episodic stream of slapstick gags, Minions has moments of piquant absurdity, but mostly its shrill-but-cutesy anarchy works as a visual sugar rush for the preschool set".[54] Accolades[edit] This section needs expansion.
