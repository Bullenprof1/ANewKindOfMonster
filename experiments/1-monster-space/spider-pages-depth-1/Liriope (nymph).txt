Liriope was raped by the river-god Cephissus, who was himself the son of Pontus and Thalassa, and bore his son Narcissus.[1] LIRIOPE was a Naiad-nymph of Phokis (in central Greece). She bore the river-god Kephisos (Cephisus) a beautiful son named Narkissos (Narcissus) who was transformed into his namesake flower. Liriope's name means "Face of the Narcissus" from the Greek words leirion "narcissus" and ops "face." Her son was also named for the flower--narkissos in Greek. Leiron and narkissos might be the same plant or could represent two different species of daffodil. Liriope was probably identified with Lilaia, the Naiad-nymph of the springs of the river Kephisos.
