Dungeons & Dragons retro-clones are fantasy role-playing games that seek to emulate earlier editions of Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) no longer supported by Wizards of the Coast. They are mostly made possible by the terms of the Open Game License and System Reference Document, which allows the use of much of the proprietary terminology of D&D that might otherwise collectively constitute copyright infringement. While these rules lack the name D&D or any of the associated trademarks, their intent is to have a playable experience similar to those older editions.

In addition, new games have been published which address the perceived inability of newer editions to preserve the tone of classic D&D while still fixing some of the perceived rules issues of older versions. Castles & Crusades is one such example, utilizing the unified d20 mechanic from 3rd edition while dropping what the developers perceived as complications (Feats, Skills, Prestige Classes, etc.). Role-playing game publisher Matthew Finch was involved in the development of Castles & Crusades, serving as editor of the Player's Handbook, and was the initial author of OSRIC, which was afterward taken up by Stuart Marshall and released to the public in 2006 as a retro-clone of the first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1977–1989). The release prompted another game designer, Daniel Proctor, to write and release Labyrinth Lord in 2007, a more complete retro-clone of the 1981 version of the Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set and its accompanying Expert Set. The following year, Finch announced the release of Swords & Wizardry, a retro-clone of the original Dungeons & Dragons game. Many variants have appeared since the original release of OSRIC, as well as restatements of other editions of D&D and other adventure role-playing games. The games are fostered and supported online by various forums and blogs, sometimes collectively referred to as the Old School Revival (OSR), but are also increasingly finding their way into brick and mortar game stores. Notable retro-clones[edit] OSRIC[edit] Main article: OSRIC OSRIC, short for Old School Reference and Index Compilation, is a recreation of the first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, and one of the most successful retro-clones.[1]:366 The initial version of OSRIC was released in 2006. The latest version, OSRIC v. 2.2, was released in 2013.[2] Labyrinth Lord[edit] Main article: Labyrinth Lord Labyrinth Lord (LL) is a retro-clone written and edited by Daniel Proctor and published by Goblinoid Games in 2007. LL takes its inspiration from the 1981 Basic Set edited by Tom Moldvay and the accompanying Expert Set by David "Zeb" Cook.[3] Any adventure written to be played with classic D&D can be run using LL with little or no adjustment. However, there are a few differences between the two games. It extends the rules so characters can advance to 20th level (the 1981 Expert Set only included levels up to 14). In addition, in a nod to Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, clerics receive spells at first level. Basic Fantasy[edit] Main article: Basic Fantasy Basic Fantasy is a retro-clone written by Chris Gonnerman that emulates, and is largely compatible with, the 1981 Basic and Expert sets. Its differences from B/X D&D include d20-style ascending armor class and separation of character race and class. It was first released in 2007,[4] and updated in 2008,[5] and 2014.[6] The game has been positively received.[7][8] Swords & Wizardry[edit] Swords & Wizardry Designer(s) Matthew Finch Publisher(s) Mythmere Games via Frog God Games Publication date 2008 Years active 2008–present Genre(s) Fantasy Playing time Varies Random chance Dice rolling Skill(s) required Role-playing, improvisation, tactics, arithmetic Website froggodgames.com/frogs/product-category/swords-wizardry-2/ Swords & Wizardry (S&W), developed by Mythmere Games, emulates the original 1974 edition of Dungeons & Dragons. Swords & Wizardry won the Silver for the 2009 ENnie Award for Best Free Product.[9] There are three different versions of the game available. White Box, a streamlined game emulating the rules and options of just the original 1974 boxed set without expansions, creating a play style omitting many elements that were later introduced to D&D. Core, which uses some expanded rules to include most classic game elements. Complete, including nearly all of the rules and options added to the original game from supplements and articles. Dark Dungeons[edit] Dark Dungeons Designer(s) "Blacky the Blackball" Publisher(s) Self-published Publication date 2010 Years active 2010–present Genre(s) Fantasy Playing time Varies Random chance Dice rolling Skill(s) required Role-playing, improvisation, tactics, arithmetic Website gurbintrollgames.wordpress.com/dark-dungeons/ Dark Dungeons has as its primary inspiration the 1991 Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia, with secondary inspiration (particularly for the cosmology of the default game setting) coming from the 1989 Spelljammer campaign setting. The name Dark Dungeons and the names of the sample characters (and their players) found in examples throughout the text are used in parody of the Chick Tract of the same name. Because Dark Dungeons emulates the Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia, which itself contains collected and edited rules from the Basic, Expert, Companion, and Master sets published from 1983–1985, it is strongly compatible with most adventures and supplements designed for those sets. However, while Dark Dungeons does include rules for immortal level play, those rules are primarily inspired by the 1993 Wrath of the Immortals supplement to the Rules Cyclopedia and are therefore not readily compatible with adventures and supplements designed for the 1985 Immortals Set. Mazes & Perils[edit] Mazes & Perils Designer(s) Vincent Florio Publisher(s) Wild Games Productions Publication date 2011 2015 Deluxe Edition Years active 2011–present Genre(s) Fantasy Playing time Varies Random chance Dice rolling Skill(s) required Role-playing, improvisation, tactics, arithmetic Website www.drivethrurpg.com/product/181899/Mazes--Perils-Deluxe-Edition Mazes & Perils RPG (M&P) is a retro-clone developed by Wild Games Productions, emulating the 1977 version of the Basic Set edited by John Eric Holmes. M&P expands the game from its original level limit of level 3 up to level 12. It won the 2013 ENnie Award for Best Free Game[10] An expanded Deluxe Edition featuring new classes was released in 2015.[11] For Gold & Glory[edit] For Gold & Glory Designer(s) Justen Brown & Moses Wildermuth Publisher(s) Self-published Publication date 2012 Years active 2012–present Genre(s) Fantasy Playing time Varies Random chance Dice rolling Skill(s) required Role-playing, improvisation, tactics, arithmetic For Gold & Glory is a retro-clone of the AD&D 2nd edition rules from 1989.
