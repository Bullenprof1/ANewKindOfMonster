Barbaro and Black are also co-founders of the South by Southwest Festival, although the festival operates as a separate company.[3] The paper initially was published bi-weekly, and later weekly. Its precursor in style and format was the Austin Sun, a bi-weekly that had ceased operations in 1978, after four years of publication.[4] The first issue of the Chronicle was distributed on September 4, 1981. With a progressive point of view and irreverent voice, the Chronicle covers local and state news as well as the Austin food, film, theater, art and music communities. The paper also has a number of annual features, including the 'Best of Austin' awards, cut-out masks for Halloween, the April Fools' edition, and the First Plates Restaurant Awards. The Chronicle produces the annual Austin Chronicle Hot Sauce Festival, normally held in late August. Characteristics of its working methods[edit] It is a profit-oriented business that receives income from advertisements.[2] The newspaper endorses electoral candidates and its reporters check official sources.[2] References[edit] ^ "Texas Music Industry Directory" (PDF).
