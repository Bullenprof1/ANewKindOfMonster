It was founded in 1893[2] to publish scholarly and scientific works by faculty of the University of California, established 25 years earlier in 1868, and has been officially headquartered at the University's flagship campus in Berkeley, California, since its inception.[3] As the non-profit publishing arm of the University of California system, the UC Press is fully subsidized by the University and the State of California.[3] A third of its authors are faculty members of the University. The Press publishes over 250 new books and almost four dozen multi-issue journals annually, in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, and maintains approximately 4,000 book titles in print.[4] It is also the digital publisher of Collabra and Luminos open access (OA) initiatives. The University of California Press publishes in the following subjects: African studies, American studies, ancient world (classics), anthropology, art, Asian studies, communication, criminology & criminal justice, economics, environmental studies, film & media studies, food & wine, gender & sexuality, global studies, health, history, language, Latin American studies, literary studies & poetry, Middle Eastern studies, music, philosophy, politics, psychology, religion, sciences, and sociology.[4] The Press has its administrative office in downtown Oakland, California, an editorial branch office in Los Angeles, and a sales office in New York, and distributes through marketing offices in Great Britain, Asia, Australia, and Latin America. A Board consisting of senior officers of the University of California, headquartered in Berkeley, holds responsibility for the operations of the Press, and authorizes and approves all manuscripts for publication. The Editorial Committee consists of distinguished faculty members representing the University's nine campuses.[3] The Press commissioned as its corporate typeface University of California Old Style from type designer Frederic Goudy from 1936 to 1938, although it no longer always uses the design.[5][6][7][8] Contents 1 Notable books 2 Open access (OA) programs at UC Press 3 Notable series 4 References 5 Further reading 6 External links Notable books[edit] Language As Symbolic Action, Kenneth Burke (1966) The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge, Carlos Castaneda (1968) Technicians of the Sacred: A Range of Poetries from Africa, America, Asia, Europe and Oceania, Jerome Rothenberg (1968; 50th anniversary edition 2017) The Mysterious Stranger, Mark Twain (definitive edition) (1969, based on work first published in 1916) Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution (1969) The Making of a Counter Culture, Theodore Roszak (1970) Self-Consuming Artifacts: The Experience of Seventeenth-Century Literature, Stanley Fish (1972) The Ancient Economy, Moses I.

With the same high standards for selection, peer review, production, and marketing as its traditional book publishing program, Luminos is a transformative model, built as a partnership where costs and benefits are shared.[10] Notable series[edit] The University of California Press re-printed a number of novels under the California Fiction series from 1996 to 2001. These titles were selected for their literary merit and for their illumination of California history and culture.[11][12] The Ford by Mary Austin Thieves' Market by A.I.
