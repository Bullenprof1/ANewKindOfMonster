The first county commissioners were sworn in on 23 April 1810. It lost some land area during the formation of neighboring counties until it reached its present boundaries in 1851, after Buffalo, Beaver, Olive, and Seneca townships were gained by Noble county. After dispute whether the county seat should be established in Cambridge or Washington, it was established in Cambridge after two individuals proposed to donate the land and furnish the public buildings if built in Cambridge.[5] Geography[edit] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 528 square miles (1,370 km2), of which 522 square miles (1,350 km2) is land and 6.0 square miles (16 km2) (1.1%) is water.[6] Demographics[edit] Historical population Census Pop. %± 1810 3,051 — 1820 9,292 204.6% 1830 18,036 94.1% 1840 27,748 53.8% 1850 30,438 9.7% 1860 24,474 −19.6% 1870 23,838 −2.6% 1880 27,197 14.1% 1890 28,645 5.3% 1900 34,425 20.2% 1910 42,716 24.1% 1920 45,352 6.2% 1930 41,486 −8.5% 1940 38,822 −6.4% 1950 38,452 −1.0% 1960 38,579 0.3% 1970 37,665 −2.4% 1980 42,024 11.6% 1990 39,024 −7.1% 2000 40,792 4.5% 2010 40,087 −1.7% 2019 (est.) 38,875 [7] −3.0% U.S. Decennial Census[8] 1790-1960[9] 1900-1990[10] 1990-2000[11] 2010-2019[2] 2000 census[edit] As of the census[12] of 2000, there were 40,792 people, 16,094 households, and 11,233 families living in the county.
