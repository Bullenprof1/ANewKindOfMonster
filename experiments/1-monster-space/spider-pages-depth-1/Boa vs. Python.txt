Contents 1 Plot 2 Cast 3 Release 4 Reception 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Plot[edit] Two masked wrestlers, one named "Boa" the other "Python", are grappling. Enjoying this spectacle is multi-millionaire casino owner Broddick (Adam Kendrick) and his girlfriend Eve (Angel Boris). Their night out is interrupted by a phone call. The caller, Ramon informs Broddick that his "package" has arrived overseas from South America and is being delivered. Broddick is delighted and promises lucrative compensation to Ramon for his work. During the journey, whatever is sealed inside the back of the truck has awakened and become enraged. Ramon stops the convoy and gets a tranquilizer gun, ordering a panel to be opened. Unfortunately, a serpentine tail smashes through the panel and begins to wreak havoc. One of the men is startled and fires his gun, accidentally hitting the main control circuit on the back of the truck. The main door of the sealed container opens, and an abnormally large, nightmarish reticulated python, about 80 ft (24 m) long and 12 t (26,000 lb), emerges and kills the group. Ramon detonates a bomb in the process, destroying the convoy, but not the snake. Broddick reveals his plan to bring extreme big-game hunting to the city, as yet another pastime for the mega-wealthy, and the python is to be the quarry. Broddick then sees a news report detailing the destruction of Ramon's convoy. Now realizing the python has escaped, Broddick decides to bring his big-game hunting associates to their prey. FBI Agent Alan Sharpe (Kirk B.R. Woller) investigates the wrecked convoy and discovers a large snake scale on the wreckage. Quickly realizing what he is up against (Agent Sharpe is familiar with the events in the film Python), Sharpe is determined to prevent the snake from killing more people. He enlists herpetologist Dr. Steven Emmett (David Hewlett) and marine biologist Monica Bonds (Jaime Bergman) to devise a plan to stop the python. They plan to merge Monica's dolphin-camera headgear and tracking system to Dr. Emmett's giant 70 ft (21 m) long, 11.5 t (25,000 lb), genetically enhanced Scarlet Boa named Betty. They hope Betty will seek out and kill the python. The trio, now joined by a backup team of FBI agents and US Army soldiers, transports Betty to the water treatment facility. She quickly enters and begins to track the python. The tracking system proves faulty, providing only sporadic coverage. Broddick and his surviving hunters enter the opposite end of the treatment facility and begin to track the reptile. They are surprised when they stumble upon a nest of eggs, guarded by Betty, whom they had not expected to see. Betty constricts Eve, killing her, which causes Broddick to snap. Eventually, he makes his way out alone, the rest of his team being killed by both snakes. Broddick finally meets up with Dr. Emmett and Monica. The python devours the eggs, enraging Betty, who engages the python in a fight. Broddick is taken into custody. The tracking system starts to function again, and Dr. Emmett finally sees Betty's nest. He decides to go back into the treatment facility to save the nest. Monica goes with him. Broddick, however, has sneaked away and commandeered an APC. Dr. Emmett and Monica, using the tracking system, track Betty to a nightclub. Betty smashes through the floor, as does the giant python. The two snakes grab Broddick and, in a vicious and bloody tug-of-war, bisect him, each devouring their half. The two snakes continue their battle underneath the disco, with Dr. Emmett and Monica hot on their trail. The battling snakes end up fighting on subway tracks. Betty is winning, but a train is about to run over both combatants. Betty is saved by Dr. Emmett, who activates an electrical spike device he implanted into her head. The shock throws her off the tracks just as a speeding bullet train slams into the python and beheads the beast. Dr. Emmett and Monica celebrate the death of the python, but become concerned when it is revealed Betty has crawled away. The duo heads back into the treatment facility to bring Betty and her remaining eggs home. Cast[edit] David Hewlett as Dr. Steven Emmett Jaime Bergman as Monica Bonds Kirk B.R.

You can help by adding to it. (January 2018) Boa vs. Python was panned by reviewers, who criticized the acting, special effects, and storyline.[2] It has been called a rip-off of Alien vs. Predator (2004) and an attempt to cash in on the popularity of the more popular Python (2000). Reel Film.com awarded the film one and a half out of four stars, criticizing the film's special effects, and expressed disappointment with the film's lack of suitable violence.[3] See also[edit] List of killer snake films References[edit] ^ "Boa vs. Python (2004) - David Flores".
