Pier Leone Ghezzi, The Purification of Aeneas in the River Numicius The Numicus was a river of ancient Latium which flowed into the sea between the towns of Lavinium and Ardea. According to the mythology of Livy, Aeneas lies buried on its banks[1] (from the original: 'Situs est, quemcumque eum dici ius fasque est super Numicum flumen'). The river is also represented in ancient texts as a river-god Numicius (Greek: "Nomikios"). As described by Ovid, at the behest of Venus, Numicus cleans Aeneas of all of his mortal parts so that he may become a god, known as Indiges.[2] References[edit] ^ Titus Livius (translated by Rev.
