If You're Happy, Clap Your Hands).[1] Yuasa's next project was a film tentatively tiled Dai gunju Nezura (lit. The Great Rat Swarm) which would involve real rats crawling over miniatures of cities.[1] The rats received for the film had fleas, which halted production on Dai gunju Nezura.[1] As the miniatures for the film were already built, Masaichi Nagata had to develop a giant monster to attack the city and had the idea for a giant flying turtle.[1] Yuasa, with his screenwriter Nisan Takahashi, developed the idea into the 1965 film Gamera the Giant Monster.[1] Yuasa continued work directing films in the series except Gamera vs. Barugon, where he was only the special effects director. Yuasa's personal favourite of his Gamera films was Gamera vs. Viras.[1] Following the collapse of Daiei in 1971, he predominantly directed work for television, including Electroid Zaborger (1974) and Ultraman 80 (1980).[1][2] His last full film was Gamera, Super Monster, which included extensive stock footage from the previous seven Gamera films.[1][2] He later worked on smaller V-Cinema videos such as Kosupure senshi kyūtī naito 2 teikoku-ya no gyakushū (transl. Cosplay Warrior Cutie ・ Night 2 Counterattack of Imperial Shop).[3][unreliable source?] Yuasa died of a stroke in Japan on 14 June 2004.[4] Select filmography[edit] Film[edit] Title Year Credited as Notes Ref(s) Director Special effects director Shiawase nara te o tatakō 1964 Yes [1] Gamera the Giant Monster 1965 Yes [1] Gamera vs. Barugon 1966 Yes [5] Gamera vs. Gyaos 1967 Yes [1] Gamera vs. Viras 1968 Yes [1] The Snake Girl and the Silver-Haired Witch Yes [6][7] Gamera vs. Guiron 1969 Yes [1] Gamera vs. Jiger 1970 Yes [1] Gamera vs. Zigra 1971 Yes [1] Gamera, Super Monster 1980 Yes [1] Television[edit] Denjin Zaborger (1974) Ultraman 80 (1980) V-Cinema[edit] Kosupure senshi kyūtī naito 2 teikoku-ya no gyakushū (1996) Notes[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u Fischer 2011, p. 657. sfn error: no target: CITEREFFischer2011 (help) ^ a b Fischer 2011, p. 658. sfn error: no target: CITEREFFischer2011 (help) ^ "コスプレ戦士 キューティー・ナイト２ 帝国屋の逆襲" (in Japanese).
