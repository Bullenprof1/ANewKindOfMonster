Contents 1 Plot 2 Cast 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Plot[edit] A group of Delta Force soldiers, accompanied by Russian born CIA agent Katya Zemanova (Pollyanna McIntosh), are sent to the Belzan forest in Chechnya in search of a rogue American weapons researcher, Dr. Benton Walsh.[1] As they search for Walsh's camp, they are attacked by genetically-altered carnivorous bats.[1] The survivors attempt to reach helicopter extraction but encounter various challenges, including Chechen rebels. Most of the force was killed during the mission along with other groups of rebels, and only four members of Delta force, including Captain Russo manage to survive. Russo, the leader, finally discovers Walsh, who has become "immune" to the bats by injecting special chemicals into him. Russo kills the doctor and get back to the rebel camp, using a high-power microphone to send out noises to lure the bats back to the camp, where he ignites the fuel tanks and blasts the camp, killing all of the bats except one that survives at the end of the film, flying off a farmer's wagon. Russo, Downey, and Katya escape.
