J. Abrams and Lindsey Weber and written by Josh Campbell, Matthew Stuecken, and Damien Chazelle. The film stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead, John Goodman, and John Gallagher Jr. It is the second installment in the Cloverfield franchise. The story follows a young woman who, after a car crash, wakes up in an underground bunker with two men who insist that an event has left the surface of Earth uninhabitable. The film was developed from a script titled The Cellar; but under production by Bad Robot, it was turned into a spiritual successor to the 2008 film Cloverfield. It is presented in a third-person narrative, in contrast to its predecessor's found-footage style. Principal photography took place under the title Valencia in New Orleans, Louisiana, from October 20 to December 15, 2014. 10 Cloverfield Lane premiered in New York City on March 8, 2016, and was released in select countries on March 10. It was released in the United States on March 11, 2016, in both conventional and IMAX formats. The film grossed over $110 million worldwide and was praised for its performances, screenplay, and atmosphere. A successor, The Cloverfield Paradox, was released on February 4, 2018.

Driving through rural Louisiana at night, Ben calls her, begging her to return. Hearing news reports of blackouts in several major cities, her car is suddenly struck and rolls off the road. She awakes in a concrete room, chained to the wall by a man named Howard. After she unsuccessfully ambushes him, he explains that he came across the wreck and saved her life by bringing her to his underground bunker after there had been a massive attack by maybe Russians or Martians. He tells a doubtful Michelle that everyone outside is dead, and because the air is poisoned they cannot leave for one or two years. Howard takes her on a tour of the well-stocked bunker he built, meeting the other resident, Emmett. Through a viewport Howard shows her his two decayed pigs outside, as evidence of the fallout. But when she also sees Howard's truck, she regains the memory of it forcing her off the road. She privately relays this to Emmett, who dismisses it. He says that he saw the attack, and so came to the bunker and fought his way inside. During their first dinner together that night, Howard shows flashes of jealousy and rage. Michelle attacks him and steals his keys, but as she is about to open the outer door, a woman covered with lesions bangs on the viewport, screaming to be let inside. Horrified, Michelle returns to the bunker. Howard confesses that in actuality, he accidentally struck Michelle's car in a panic to get to his bunker. Using her fashion design skills, she stitches his cut that she caused. The trio begin adapting to life underground, but Howard shows little tolerance for Emmett. Howard opens up about his daughter, whom he describes as being "not with us anymore." When something loud passes overhead, the ventilator fails, and Howard recruits Michelle to crawl through a duct to turn it back on, where she finds a padlocked skylight with "HELP" scratched on the inside. Michelle and Emmett discover that Howard's purported daughter was actually a local girl who had gone missing two years earlier. With Emmett’s help, they pilfer tools that she uses to secretly fashion a makeshift hazmat suit, so one of them can go outside to get help. Howard finds some of the hidden tools, and threatens to immerse both of them in a barrel of perchloric acid. Emmett takes responsibility, claiming that he was building a weapon to get Howard's gun to impress Michelle. Howard shoots Emmett in the head, telling a shocked Michelle that now they can be a family of two. As Michelle is finishing the suit, Howard discovers it, and throws her across the room. She flees and when he chases, she upends the barrel of acid into him. As a fire ignites inside, and a disfigured Howard hunts her, she dons the suit and escapes outside. When she sees birds overhead, she removes the gas mask. However, she observes a tentacled biomechanical craft floating in the distance. When the bunker explodes it draws the craft’s attention, and Michelle is stalked by a quadrupedal creature. When she shelters in Howard's truck, the craft's tentacles draw the truck towards its maw. Finding materials for a Molotov cocktail, she destroys the craft. Michelle drives off. A recording on the radio instructs survivors to head to Baton Rouge to evacuate to safety, but also requests the help of anyone with medical or combat training in Houston. Being at a crossroads, she turns for Houston. Cast[edit] Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle[6] John Goodman as Howard Stambler[7] John Gallagher Jr. as Emmett DeWitt Douglas M. Griffin as Driver Suzanne Cryer as Leslie Bradley Cooper as Ben (voice)[8] Sumalee Montano as Voice on Radio Frank Mottek as Radio Broadcaster (voice) Kayla Bechor as Paper Girl (uncredited) Production[edit] Development[edit] John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. 10 Cloverfield Lane originated from an "ultra low budget" spec script penned by Josh Campbell and Matt Stuecken, titled The Cellar.[9][10] The Tracking Board included the script in "The Hit List" of 2012[10] – an annually published list of spec scripts written within the year that have impressed its voting members.[11] In 2012, Paramount Pictures bought the script and commenced further development under Bad Robot Productions for Insurge Pictures, Paramount's specialty label for films with a micro-budget. When Bad Robot became involved, the film was assigned the codename Valencia to keep exact details of the production a secret.[12] Damien Chazelle was brought in to rewrite Campbell and Stuecken's draft and direct the film. Chazelle dropped out from directing when his Whiplash project received funding.[6] On April 3, 2014, it was reported production for Valencia was greenlit to begin in the fall of 2014, under the direction of Dan Trachtenberg with the latest draft being written by an uncredited Daniel Casey.[13] A budget of about $5 million was reported to be expected, in keeping with the mandate of Paramount's Insurge division of producing micro-budgeted films.[14] On July 8, 2014, Variety reported John Goodman was in negotiations to star in the film.[15] On August 25, 2014, they reported Mary Elizabeth Winstead had entered negotiations,[16] and on September 22, 2014, John Gallagher Jr. reportedly joined the cast.[17] During production, the filmmakers noticed core similarities to Cloverfield,[18] and decided to make the picture what Abrams calls "a blood relative" or "spiritual successor" of that film.[19][20] "The spirit of it, the genre of it, the heart of it, the fear factor, the comedy factor, the weirdness factor, there were so many elements that felt like the DNA of this story were of the same place that Cloverfield was born out of," said Abrams. In other interviews he explained: "Those characters and that monster [from Cloverfield] are not in this movie, but there are other characters and other monsters,"[20] and "This movie is very purposefully not called Cloverfield 2, because it's not Cloverfield 2, [...] So if you're approaching it as a literal sequel, you'll be surprised to see what this movie is. But while it's not what you might expect from a movie that has the name Cloverfield in it, I think you'll find that you'll understand the connection when you see the whole thing."[21][22][23] Winstead and Gallagher mentioned that during production they were aware that the film had thematic similarities to Cloverfield, but did not learn that there would be an official connection until they were informed of the chosen title, only a few days before the release of the trailer.[24] Abrams came up with the title after finishing Star Wars: The Force Awakens.[25][26] In a March 2015 interview, a few months after production wrapped, Winstead was asked about her experience during Valencia and described it as a "really contained film", reiterating the premise of The Cellar about a woman being trapped with her mysterious savior in a supposed post-nuclear fallout world.[27] Later in the month, Insurge Pictures was reported to have been dismantled and its staff absorbed by its parent company. Insurge's only film that had yet to be released was reported to be Valencia.[28] Speaking of rewrites that took place during production, Winstead called them "nothing that was major".[29] During an interview with Abrams to promote 10 Cloverfield Lane, he said the creative team behind the original had some ideas on developing Cloverfield 2, but the release of films such as Godzilla and Pacific Rim led them to abandon them as they found the concept of kaiju films played out.[21] Filming[edit] Principal photography on the film began on October 20, 2014, in New Orleans, Louisiana.[30] Filming took place in chronological order on only one set.[31] Scenes involving explosions, fire, and smoke were shot in early December 2014 in Hahnville, Louisiana.[32] Filming ended on December 15, 2014.[33] Music[edit] Bear McCreary composed the music for the film.[31] The soundtrack was digitally released on March 11, 2016.[34] Marketing[edit] The film's title was revealed on January 15, 2016 in a trailer attached to 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi.[19] As with Cloverfield, a viral marketing campaign was used that included elements of an alternate reality game. Bad Robot kick-started the campaign in early February 2016 by updating the Tagruato.jp website used for the original film.[7] The campaign revealed backstory information about the character Howard Stambler and his daughter.[35] Release[edit] The film was released in select countries on March 10, 2016, in regular and IMAX theaters, before its official release in North America on March 11, also in conventional and IMAX theaters.[36] Those who attended screenings of the film at AMC IMAX theaters were eligible to receive collectible movie posters, which illustrated the three main characters separately.[37] The film was rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for "thematic material including frightening sequences of threat with some violence, and brief language".[38] Reception[edit] Box office[edit] 10 Cloverfield Lane grossed $72.2 million in the United States and $38.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $110.2 million.[5] In the United States and Canada, the film made $1.8 million from its Thursday night previews at 2,500 theaters,[39][40][41] and $8 million on its first day (including Thursday previews).[42] In its opening weekend, it earned $24.7 million, finishing in second place at the box office behind Zootopia ($51.3 million), which was in its second weekend.[43] Outside North America, 10 Cloverfield Lane received a staggered release,[44] across 54 countries.[45] It earned $1.5 million in its opening weekend from six international markets with a bulk of it coming from Australia ($1 million).[44] Overall, the top openings were in the United Kingdom and Ireland ($2.2 million), South Korea ($1.7 million), and France ($1.4 million).[46][47] Critical response[edit] On Rotten Tomatoes, 90% of 312 critic reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Smart, solidly crafted, and palpably tense, 10 Cloverfield Lane makes the most of its confined setting and outstanding cast—and suggests a new frontier for franchise filmmaking."[48] According to Metacritic, which calculated a weighted average score of 76 out of 100 based on 43 critics, the film received "generally favorable reviews".[49] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B–" on an A+ to F scale.[50] Bill Zwecker of the Chicago Sun-Times gave 10 Cloverfield Lane four stars out of four, commending the film as "continually gripping and extremely engrossing ... [Dan Trachtenberg] helmed this film with artistry, imagination and skillful precision."[51] Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times praised the cast's performance and Jeff Cutter's cinematography, while writing: "Sneakily tweaking our fears of terrorism, '10 Cloverfield Lane,' though no more than a kissing cousin to its namesake, is smartly chilling and finally spectacular. A sequel is virtually a given."[52] Alan Scherstuhl of the Village Voice also praised the acting and technical aspects, but wrote that the film "is less compelling in terms of character and meaning."[53] In a mixed review for Slant, Chuck Bowen found a lack of character development between the three leads, and labeled the film's ending as anticlimactic. Bowen also writes: "The film hits its expositional narrative marks and nothing else ... 10 Cloverfield Lane will almost immediately evaporate from the mind, before J.J. Abrams commences in selling you the same thing all over again."[54] Soren Andersen of the Seattle Times, who gave 10 Cloverfield Lane one and half stars out of four, similarly criticized the film's ending, labeling it as "full-bore" and "Too little. Too late."[55] James Verniere of the Boston Herald disapproved of the characters and pacing, and he ultimately described the film as "a crummy, low-rent, intellectually bereft thriller."[56] Accolades[edit] Association Category Nominee(s) Result Ref.

In The Cloverfield Paradox, Donal Logue cameos as Mark Stambler, a conspiracy theorist discussing the "Cloverfield Paradox"; reviewers observed that the character shares the same surname as Howard Stambler in 10 Cloverfield Lane.[73] Suzanne Cryer, who appeared as Leslie in 10 Cloverfield Lane, also appears in a brief cameo role as a newscaster who interviews Stambler.[73] See also[edit] List of films featuring extraterrestrials References[edit] ^ "10 Cloverfield Lane (12A)".
