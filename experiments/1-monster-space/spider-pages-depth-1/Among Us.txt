It was released on iOS and Android devices in June 2018 and on Windows in November 2018, featuring cross-platform play between these platforms.[4] The game was also ported for the Nintendo Switch in December 2020, and has planned releases for the Xbox One and Xbox Series X and Series S in 2021. The game was inspired by the party game Mafia and the science fiction horror film The Thing, and since the release of its first map, The Skeld, other maps were added into the game. A fourth map, "The Airship", was released in March 2021. The game takes place in a space-themed setting, in which players each take on one of two roles, most being Crewmates, and a predetermined number being Impostors.[d] The goal of the Crewmates is to identify the Impostors, eliminate them, and complete tasks around the map; the Impostors' goal is to covertly sabotage and kill the Crewmates before they complete all of their tasks. Players suspected to be Impostors may be eliminated via a plurality vote, which any player may initiate by calling an emergency meeting (except during a crisis) or reporting a dead body. Crewmates win if all Impostors are eliminated or all tasks are completed, whereas Impostors win if there is an equal number of Impostors and Crewmates, or if a critical sabotage goes unresolved. While the game was initially released in 2018 to little mainstream attention, it received a massive influx of popularity in 2020 due to many well-known Twitch streamers, and YouTubers playing it. The COVID-19 pandemic has also been credited to the growth of the game.[15] The game received positive reviews from critics, being praised for its gameplay and setting, although it was criticized for its technical issues. In response to the game's popularity, Among Us 2 was announced in August 2020. However, the planned sequel was canceled a month later, and the team shifted its focus to improving the original game. Merchandise based on the game, such as toys, shirts, etc., were announced and released. Among Us has also inspired internet memes and achieved a very large following online.

Because of the game's vision mechanic, the pink player is partially obscured. Among Us is a multiplayer game for four to ten players. Up to three players are randomly[16] chosen to be the impostor(s) each round. A round can take place on one of four maps: a spaceship called "The Skeld"; a headquarters building called "MIRA HQ"; a planet base called "Polus";[17] or "The Airship", which is based on the Henry Stickmin series.[18][19] At the start of the game, Crewmates are assigned "tasks" to complete around the map in the form of minigames, consisting of maintenance work on vital systems such as fixing wires and downloading data.[20] Impostors are given a fake list of tasks to blend in with Crewmates. However, they are unable actually to perform any task. Impostors can sabotage vital systems (such as the ship's oxygen supply), covertly travel through vents, and work with other Impostors to kill Crewmates. If a player dies, they become a ghost. Ghosts can pass through walls, spectate other players, and chat with other ghosts.[21] Living players have a limited cone of vision,[22] but ghosts do not have this limitation.[23] Ghosts help their living teammates by completing their tasks (as a Crewmate) or performing sabotages (as an Impostor).[17] The Impostors win when they kill enough Crewmates to be equal in number, or when the Crewmates fail to resolve a major sabotage.[21] The Crewmates win by completing all tasks, or by identifying and ejecting all Impostors.[17] Games can also end by players quitting the match if doing so fulfills any win condition (if a crewmate quits the game, their tasks are automatically considered completed).[24][25] To help the Crewmates identify Impostors, there are various surveillance systems on each map, such as security cameras system on The Skeld,[26] a doorlog in MIRA HQ,[27] and a vitals indicator in Polus.[17] Crewmates may also confirm their identity through visual tasks, which cannot be faked by Impostors.[28] Any living player may call a group meeting by reporting a dead body, or by pressing the Emergency Meeting button at any time.[21][29][30] During a meeting, players discuss who they believe is an Impostor based on the available evidence. A plurality vote is held, and the chosen player is ejected from the map and they become a ghost.[20][21] Players can communicate in a text chat,[20] but only during meetings, and only if they are alive (though ghosts can speak with one another at any time).[17][21][22] While the game does not have a built-in voice chat system, it is common for players to use external programs such as Discord.[31][32][33] In each game's lobby, various options can be adjusted to customize aspects of gameplay, such as player movement speed, the allowed number of emergency meetings, number of tasks, if there will be visual tasks,[34] or whether or not an impostor is revealed after being voted off.[35] There are also many cosmetic options, including spacesuit colors, skins, hats, and pets,[36][37] some of which are paid downloadable content.[e][6][11][22] Development and release[edit] Early development[edit] Among Us timeline 2018 iOS/Android release Windows 10 Release 2019 "MIRA HQ" release "Polus" release 2020 macOS release Nintendo Switch release 2021 PC Xbox Game Pass release "The Airship" release Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S release Among Us was inspired by the live party game Mafia,[6][39] and science fiction horror film The Thing.[40] The idea for the concept was originally gave by Marcus Bromander, co-founder of Innersloth, who had played Mafia since he was a kid.[40][41] The game was initially intended to be a mobile-only local multiplayer game with a single map.[5] Development began in 2017.[41] Originally, the game had no audio to avoid revealing hidden information in a local setting,[f] and Forest Willard mixed sounds from numerous sound packs to compose the SFX during the game's Steam release.[7] Bromander paused development on Innersloth's other game, The Henry Stickmin Collection, in order to build Among Us' first map, The Skeld.[7] When they began developing the first map, they intended that the ship was always in crisis and that the Impostors could do tasks, however, they found this "stressful" and that would affect discussions.[41] In designing maps Bromander and Artist Amy Liu would use Google images to determine what kind of details a room, such as an electrical room should have.[7] Willard described playtesting as painful and frustrating, as the game would break down during sessions forcing him to send playtesters new builds off of Google Play. The team tested the game with 8 of their friends and never tested the game with 9 or the maximum of 10 players.[7] The game was released in June 2018 to Android and iOS under the AppID of "spacemafia".[6][42] Shortly after release, Among Us had an average player count of 30 to 50 concurrent players.[34] Bromander blamed the game's poor release on Innersloth being "really bad at marketing".[5] The team nearly abandoned the project multiple times, but continued work on it due to a "small but vocal player base",[43] adding in online multiplayer, new tasks, and customization options.[43] The game was released on Steam on November 16, 2018.[5][44] Cross-platform play was supported upon release of the Steam version.[45][46] On August 8, 2019, Innersloth released a second map, MIRA HQ,[47][48] which is set on a headquarters building and was firstly announced to be in development after the incrementation of map filters during 2019's first update.[49] A third map, Polus, was added later that year on November 12 and is set on a planet base.[47][50] The fourth map, the Airship, was released on March 31, 2021 and is based on a location in the Henry Stickmin universe.[18][19] MIRA HQ and Polus were initially US$4 via in-app purchase, however their prices were reduced to $2 on January 6, 2020, then made free on June 11, 2020.[51] While the map packs are still available for purchase on all platforms, they now only provide the player the skins that were bundled with the maps.[52] According to programmer Forest Willard, the team "stuck with [the game] a lot longer than we probably should have from a pure business standpoint", putting out regular updates to the game as often as once per week. This led to a steady increase in players, snowballing the game's player base. Bromander attributed this to the studio having enough savings to keep working on the game even while it was not selling particularly well.[5] Popularity[edit] Initial spike in popularity[edit] Twitch streamer Sodapoppin, credited with popularizing Among Us on Twitch While Among Us released in 2018, it was not until mid-2020 that it saw a surge of popularity, initially driven by content creators online in South Korea and Brazil. Bromander stated that the game is more popular in Mexico, Brazil, and South Korea than the United States.[5][6] According to Willard, Twitch streamer Sodapoppin first popularized the game on Twitch in July 2020.[5] Many other Twitch streamers and YouTubers followed suit, including prominent content creators xQc, Pokimane, Shroud, Ninja, and PewDiePie.[53][54][39] The COVID-19 pandemic was frequently cited as a reason for the popularity of Among Us, as it allowed for socializing despite social distancing.[5][21][55][47] Emma Kent of Eurogamer believed that the release of Innersloth's The Henry Stickmin Collection also contributed to awareness of Among Us,[53] and PC Gamer's Wes Fenlon credited Twitch streamer SR_Kaif for "prim[ing] Among Us for its big moment." Fenlon also praised Among Us for improvements over other popular tabletop games that had been inspired by Mafia, such as Secret Hitler. He said other video game adaptation of Mafia such as Town of Salem and Werewolves Within were "just add[ing] an online interface for the basic Werewolf rules," whereas Among Us is as an entirely new take on the concept.[39] Along with Fall Guys and the Jackbox Party Packs, Among Us provided a narrative-less experience that helped to avoid the "cultural trauma" of the pandemic, according to M.J. Lewis of Wired.[56] Continued popularity[edit] The game's popularity continued into the following months. YouTube reported that videos about Among Us were viewed 4 billion times in September 2020,[57] and TikTok videos related to Among Us had over 13 billion views in October 2020.[1] YouTuber CG5 wrote a song based on the game in September 2020, titled "Show Yourself", and gained over 60 million views in 4 months.[58] In September 2020, the game exceeded 100 million downloads[39] and its player count rose to 1.5 million concurrent players[3][59] (nearly 400 thousand of which were on Steam),[47] then peaked at 3.8 million in late September.[60] The sudden increase in players overloaded the game's server, which according to Willard was "a totally free Amazon server, and it was terrible." This forced him to work quickly, under crunch time, to resolve these issues.[43] In August, Innersloth opened an online store for Among Us themed merchandise.[11][34] The game's popularity inspired many original songs, fanarts and internet memes,[26][29][43][61] Willard expressed that fan-created content "really is the best part" of making Among Us, and Bromander called it "my favorite thing to see".[43] The game popularized the slang word "sus" (meaning "suspicious or suspect"),[2][62][63][64] which had been used as a slang term before the game's release.[65] During its time of widespread popularity, Among Us was controversially played by the U.S. Navy Esports team, in which players on the stream used in-game names referencing the N-word and the bombing of Nagasaki. The stream was deemed "offensive" and "intolerable" by some viewers.[66] In October 2020, U.S. Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar streamed the game alongside several other prominent streamers such as Pokimane and Hasan Piker as a way to encourage people to vote in the 2020 United States presidential election, drawing almost 700,000 concurrent viewers on Twitch.[67][68][69][70] Amid its popularity, Innersloth considered releasing the game to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles, but encountered a problem in implementing player communication as standard text-based or voice-based chat seemed unusable. They considered a system similar to the "quick comms" system from Rocket League, as well as the possibility of developing an entirely new communication system for the game.[31][32] The game also received several mods made by the community, which added new roles, game modes, cosmetics, etc.[71] Among Us also participated from the Twitch Rivals 2020, which was held on December 4, 2020.[72] It also allowed players to get a exclusive pet during the event called "Glitch Pet" on December 18, 2020, which is the Twitch symbol.[73] Canceled sequel and ongoing updates[edit] In August 2020, the team shifted focus onto a sequel, Among Us 2.[10][11][12][13] During this time, Forest Willard and Amy Liu continued to update Among Us, increasing the maximum playerbase, adding four servers and three regions,[74] and implementing longer game codes to support more concurrent games.[75] On September 23, 2020, the team canceled the sequel, instead opting to add all content intended for the sequel to the original Among Us, due to "how many people [were] enjoying [the original game]".[76][53][77] However, Innersloth deemed the game's codebase "outdated and not built to support adding so much new content", so the team made plans to rework the game's core code to enable adding new features.[77] The team subsequently announced their plans to fix the game's server issues and widespread cheating problem,[78][79][80] as well as add a system for banning disruptive players.[81] In October 2020, colorblind support for the "wires" task arrived to the Among Us beta on Steam, as well as some previously unannounced lobby customization options.[82][83] As-of-yet unimplemented features include improving gameplay for ghosts,[84] adding customizable controls,[85] a friends system, and more player colors.[76][53][77][81] They also announced inprovement in the game's art style and lobby support for 15 players.[19] On December 10, 2020 at The Game Awards 2020, the "Airship" map was announced to be released in early 2021. Set in an airship, it will feature multiple floors, contraptions, jobs, and "more.".[86][87] In addition, Geoff Keighley's face will be a skin in Among Us. The map itself is based upon the Henry Stickmin's Toppat Clan Airship.[88] Innersloth also stated that the map would be free to all players.[89] At the same date, it was announced that Among Us will be available in Xbox Game Pass for PC at "some point in the not-too-distant future," as quoted from Shacknews.[90] On March 18, 2021, Innersloth officially announced that The Airship was set to be released on March 31, 2021.[91][92] It was released during 6pm of that day, along with a skin bundle that can be bought on Steam.[18][19] The accounts system was implemented along with the update, and it allows players to report hackers and toxic players in order to make the game a welcoming and respectful place.[93][94] Starting in mid-February 2021, a "Quickchat" was added. Because of this, birthdays and ages had to be asked every time the game was installed (uninstalling it will reset the data). Those under 18 can solely use the Quickchat, which is a set of text-based sentences that normal users would say in-game and in waiting rooms, but those over 18 are also allowed to use "Free Chat" which free typing without restrictions.[95] However, the mobile version was criticized for being a poor transition from the Switch version and numerous other bugs.[96] Among Us was released for the Nintendo Switch on December 15, 2020, the same day it was announced during Nintendo Direct Indie World showcase. The Switch version supports cross-platform play with the mobile and Windows versions.[97] Upon release, the Switch version had an exploit to access the unfinished map The Airship prior to its official release in early 2021.[98] The exploit was fixed two days after release in the Switch version's first update.[99][100] The game is planned for release on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in 2021.[101] October 2020 and January 2021 hacks[edit] In mid-October 2020, a hacker known as "Eris Loris" began targeting mainly North American servers. Several players on the Among Us subreddit and Twitter reported this player hacking their lobbies and spamming in-game chat with promotions for his YouTube channel, links to his Discord server, and controversial political messages.[102] Eris Loris also threatened to personally hack players that refused to subscribe to his YouTube channel. The Discord server has been found to contain large amounts of NSFW content such as racist language, gore, pornography and images depicting animal abuse.[103] A Eurogamer report from October 23, 2020, features an interview with the person claiming to be Eris Loris, conducted via the Discord server from one of the links provided in the hacked games. In the interview, Loris claims he created the bot responsible for the hacks "in only six hours", and had enlisted up to 50 volunteers to form a botnet which boosted the strength of their attacks. Loris claimed that the hack impacted 4.9 million players in 1.5 million games. He also added that the hacks were part of a publicity stunt to influence players to vote for Donald Trump in the 2020 United States presidential election.[103] Innersloth added an in-game message warning players about the hacks on October 22,[103] and released a statement on Twitter the next day. They said they were "super aware" of the hacking issue, and stated that an "emergency server update" would be pushed out to combat the hacks. They encouraged players to stick to private games and to avoid playing on public ones until the update was released.[104] The team plans to address the hacking vulnerabilities as part of the planned overhaul for the game.[78][79][80] At the end of January 2021, players reported on Twitter the return of Eris Loris' hack attack, which is now distributing Among Us hacks and cheats.[105] Reception[edit] Reception Aggregate score Aggregator Score Metacritic PC: 85/100[106] Switch: 79/100[107] Review scores Publication Score 4Players 68/100[108] Game Informer 8/10[109] IGN 9/10[111] Jeuxvideo.com 14/20[110] Nintendo Life 8/10[112] Among Us, in general, was well-received. On the aggregator website Metacritic, the PC port received a 85 of 100 score based on 9 critic reviews, while the Nintendo Switch version received a 79 of 100 score based on 8 critic reviews, both them indicating "generally favorable reviews".[106][107] It was also considered as one of the "Best PC Games for 2018", being ranked 17th, and as the "#38 Best Discussed PC Game of 2018".[113][114] Since December 2020, IGN considered it as one of 2020's best reviewed games so far.[115] Elliott Osange of Bonus Stage considered that the game is "silly fun", but felt that is more fun "to be an Impostor".[116] Craig Pearson of Rock, Paper, Shotgun aborded a same opinion, found playing as an Impostor "a lot more fun" than playing as a Crewmate, which he called "exhausting".[20] In reference to the game's popularity among streamers, Evelyn Lau of The National said: "Watching the reactions of people trying to guess who the impostor is (and sometimes getting it very wrong) or lying terribly about not being the impostor is all quite entertaining."[21] Alice O'Conner of Rock, Paper, Shotgun described the game as "Mafia or Werewolf but with minigames".[117] Andrew Penney of TheGamer said the game was "worth it for the price" and that "who you play with dictates how fun the game is."[22] L'avis de Tiraxa of Jeuxvideo.com praised the game's Freeplay mode, which offers newer players "to browse the map alone to accomodatte the places", as they would need to play several games in order to "perfect their strategies".[110] Leana Hafer from IGN stated in her verdict on the game: "I don't have any sus that this will be the last game of its breed to make a splash, since we’re already seeing its influence on even mega-games like Fortnite". As a negative point, she pointed out some technical problems, such as the difficulty of finding rooms that aren't already full or are a long way from getting there. She also lamented the lack of "mechanic to punish players who rage-quit when they don't get to play as impostor, or are caught dead to rights in the middle of a murder".[111] Tiraxa of Jeuxvideo.com was more critical to the game, which lamented the lack of a incremented voice chat into the game, the server bugs, which "[prevents] some from joining the party, in a totally unexplained way", the public servers with strangers, as she considered it "less entertaining" than private servers with friends, and the large development progress, considering that the game has a "bit of a way to go before it reaches its full pontential".[110] The mobile version of the game, although being free-to-play, was criticized. Osange of Bonus Stage considered that the adds and the purchase of cosmetic changes that are mostly available on the PC version are "nonsense". He also considered the PC version "stable", however, he stated that the Android version is "a device-by-device situation".[116] The Nintendo Switch version also received some criticism. William Antonieli of Insider considered that the Switch controls give "many tasks a satisfying game response". However, it also stated that most of the tasks could be "done quickly with the Switch's touchscreen control", which can only be done on the game's handheld mode, considering that most of the game's tasks don't work very well with the Switch's gamepad controls, and considered this version "inferior" to the PC and mobile versions.[118] He also stated that the communication system is "frustrating", as most of the Switch's controls doesn't work very well, such as using the joystick to select letters, which he called "slow", and the fact that the game has crossplay support puts the console's players into a "immediate disanvantage".[118] PJ'O Reilly of Nintendo Life also considered that the other port's negative point was the lack of most additional content of the game, such as skins, which he called a "shame".[112] Among Us has been frequently compared to Fall Guys, as both became popular as party games during the COVID-19 pandemic;[5][33][85] the developers of the games have both positively acknowledged each other on Twitter.[119][120] Comparisons have also been drawn between the two games' avatars, which have been said to look like jelly beans.[121][122] Among Us has also been compared to The Thing,[29][123] Town of Salem,[39][123] Werewolves Within,[39] and Secret Hitler.[39] Sales[edit] As of September 2020[update], Steam Spy estimated that the game had more than 10 million owners on Steam.[124] The Associated Press noted the game was the most downloaded app on the iOS App Store for both iPhones and iPads in October 2020.[125] According to SuperData Research, the game had roughly 500 million players worldwide as of November 2020[update], with the free-to-play mobile version accounting for 97% of players and the buy-to-play PC version accounting for 3% of players, though it was the buy-to-play PC version that generated 64% of the game's gross revenue.[126] Among Us became one of the best selling games of 2020 on Steam, being listed on the platinum category on "The Year's Top 100" list.[127][128] The Nintendo Switch version's launch sold 3.2 million digital units in December 2020, making it the highest-earning version of the game for the month and one of the best-selling games on the Nintendo Switch.[129][130] Awards[edit] Award Date of ceremony Category Result Ref.
