Volcanoes are said to form when these dragons burst out of the ground to report to heaven.[3] Several tiles and light reliefs depict Fucanglong dragons serving as mounts to Immortals[4] The Fucanglong possesses a magic pearl which is its most treasured possession. In popular culture[edit] Fucanglong appears in the digital card game Cabals: Magic & Battle Cards.
