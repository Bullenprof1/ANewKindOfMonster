It managed much of the kabuki in Tokyo and, among other properties, the eponymous Tokyo Takarazuka Theater and the Imperial Garden Theater in Tokyo; Toho and Shochiku enjoyed a duopoly over theaters in Tokyo for many years. Toho and Shochiku competed with the influx of Hollywood films and boosted the film industry by focusing on new directors of the likes of Kurosawa Akira, Ichikawa Kon, Kinoshita Keisuke, Ishiro Honda, and Shindo Kaneto.[2] After several successful film exports to the United States during the 1950s through Henry G. Saperstein, Toho took over the La Brea Theatre in Los Angeles to show its own films without the need to sell them to a distributor. It was known as the Toho Theatre from the late 1960s until the 1970s.[3] Toho also had a theater in San Francisco and opened a theater in New York City in 1963.[4] The Shintoho Company, which existed until 1961, was named New Toho because it broke off from the original company.[citation needed] Toho has contributed to the production of some American films, including Sam Raimi's 1998 film, A Simple Plan[5] and Paul W. S. Anderson's 2020 military science fiction/kaiju film, Monster Hunter.[citation needed] In 2019, Toho invested ¥15.4 billion ($14 million) into their Los Angeles-based subsidiary Toho International Inc. as part of their "Toho Vision 2021 Medium-term Management Strategy", a strategy to increase content, platform, real-estate, beat JPY50 billion profits, and increase character businesses on Toho intellectual properties such as Godzilla. Hiroyasu Matsuoka was named the representative director of the US subsidiary.[6] Major productions and distributions[edit] Film[edit] It has been suggested that this article be split into multiple articles.
