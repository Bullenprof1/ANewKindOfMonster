On May 16, 1983, it was given the name Tri-Star Pictures (when the new company was formed and did not have an official name, the press used the code-name "Nova", but the name could not be obtained as it was being used as the title for the PBS science series[4][5]). It was the first new major Hollywood studio to be established since RKO Pictures was founded in 1928.[6] The studio's first produced film in 1984 was The Natural starring Robert Redford. Their first release, however, was the film, Where the Boys Are '84; a 1984 remake of the 1960 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer picture, Where the Boys Are that was co-distributed on behalf of ITC Entertainment after Universal rejected it; the film was a commercial flop.[7] During this venture, many of Tri-Star's releases were released on VHS by either RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video, CBS/Fox Video, and HBO/Cannon Video. In addition, HBO would own exclusive cable distribution rights to these films, and broadcast television licenses would go to CBS.[8] CBS dropped out of the venture in 1985,[9] though they still distributed some of Tri-Star's films on home video until at least 1992. In 1986, HBO dropped out of the Tri-Star venture as well[failed verification] and sold half of its shares to Columbia Pictures.[10] The same year, Tri-Star entered into the television business as Tri-Star Television. It was formed when the studio joined forces with Stephen J. Cannell Productions and Witt/Thomas/Harris Productions and created a television distribution company called TeleVentures. Columbia Pictures Entertainment era (1987–1989)[edit] On December 21, 1987, Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. was renamed to Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. when Coke sold its entertainment business to Tri-Star for $3.1 billion. Both studios continued to produce and distribute films under their separate names.[11] On April 13, 1988, CPE spun off Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. as a reformed company of the Tri-Star studio.[12] Sony era (1989–present)[edit] In 1989, Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. was acquired by Sony Corporation of Japan, who merged Columbia and Tri-Star, but continued to use the separate labels. On July 11, 1990, Tri-Star Pictures dissolved and sold its venture in TeleVentures to Stephen J. Cannell Productions and TeleVentures became Cannell Distribution Co. Most of the series and the Tri-Star film packages that were distributed by TeleVentures were transferred to Columbia Pictures Television Distribution.[13] Sony Pictures Entertainment later revived TriStar Television as a television production banner in 1991 and merged with its sister television studio Columbia Pictures Television to form Columbia TriStar Television on February 21, 1994.[14][15] Both studios continued to operate separately under the CTT umbrella until TriStar folded in 1999 and CPT in 2001. In addition to its own slate, TriStar was the theatrical distributor for many films produced by Carolco Pictures (the rights to only one of their films, Cliffhanger, has been retained by TriStar). TriStar also theatrically distributed some FilmDistrict movies. Around summer 1998, SPE merged Columbia and TriStar to form the Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group, but just like Columbia Pictures Entertainment, both divisions continued producing and distributing films under their own names. TriStar was relaunched on May 13, 2004 as a marketing and acquisitions unit that had a "particular emphasis on genre films".[16] Screen Gems' executive vice president Valerie Van Galder was tapped to run the revived studio after being dormant.[17] However, the release of its 2013 film Elysium represents the label's first big-budget release since The Mask of Zorro in 1998. The same year, former 20th Century Fox co-chairman Tom Rothman joined Sony Pictures and created TriStar Productions as a joint venture with existing Sony Pictures executives. The new TriStar will develop, finance and produce up to four films per year, as well as television programming and acquisitions, starting on September 1.[18][19][20] Sony's TriStar Pictures unit will be retained for "other product, including titles from Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions", and will distribute product from the new TriStar.[21] Logo[edit] Original Tri-Star logo used from 1984 until 1993 with the release of Cliffhanger. The then-current TriStar logo used from June 25, 1993 until mid-2015, with modification in 2014. It makes a brief return in 2019’s A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood to blend with the film’s late ‘90s setting. TriStar's logo features a Pegasus (either stationary or flying across the screen). The idea came about because of executive Victor Kaufman and his family's interest in riding horses. The original logo was created with the assistance of Sydney Pollack, who was an adviser at Tri-Star. The horse in that logo was the same one used in Pollack's film The Electric Horseman. The horse in that film was dark, so Pollack had the image altered to look white in the logo.[22] The second logo was originally painted by Alan Reingold and debuted in 1992 (same time as the television division), along with sister studio Columbia Pictures, with both logos sharing a background of clouds.[23] The theatrical version was animated by Intralink Creative in 1993. The white stallion was shot in a hangar at the Santa Monica Airport. The wings were done by combining real white feathers and computer-generated-imagery then merged with Pegasus by computer morphing. The background is nighttime blue. The clouds were shot from the Haleakala Crater on Maui.[24] In 2015, a new TriStar Pictures logo was made and debuted in The Walk. This time, it was animated by JAMM VFX.[25] The clouds are completely white in this iteration and it's clearly daytime; also, the Pegasus itself is white. The original TriStar Pictures theme, which accompanied the studio's logo, was composed by jazz musician Dave Grusin.[26] The theme was remixed in 1993 by Bill Johnson and again in 1998.
