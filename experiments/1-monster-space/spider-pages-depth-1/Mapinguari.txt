Contents 1 Description 2 Terminology 3 See also 4 References 5 Sources Description[edit] Depictions of the mapinguari vary. Sometimes it is described as a hairy humanoid cyclops. Other people claim that it is based on a cultural memory of the giant ground sloth, a long-extinct animal that it is said to resemble. The creature is often said to have a gaping mouth on its abdomen.[1] Terminology[edit] According to Felipe Ferreira Vander Velden, its name is a contraction of the Tupi-Guarani words "mbaé", "pi", and "guari", meaning "a thing that has a bent [or] crooked foot [or] paw".[2] Other names which have been said to apply to the same being include the Karitiana kida harara,[2] and the Machiguenga segamai.[1][3] See also[edit] List of legendary creatures Mylodon References[edit] ^ a b Rohter, Larry (2007-07-08).
