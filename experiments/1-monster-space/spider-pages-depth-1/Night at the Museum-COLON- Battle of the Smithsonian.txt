After work one day, he stops by the museum, where Dr. McPhee tells him that most of the exhibits are being moved to the Federal Archives at the Smithsonian Institution, being replaced with holographic information providers. Larry spends one last night with his exhibit friends. Shortly before dawn, Teddy Roosevelt tells Larry that the Tablet of Ahkmenrah would be staying as one of the only original exhibits at the museum, along with Teddy, Rexy, and Ahkmenrah himself. All of the other exhibits going to the Smithsonian (including the Huns, Neanderthals, miniatures, Sacagawea, and Dexter) would therefore lose the ability to come to life at night. After the exhibits are moved the following day, Larry surprisingly receives a phone call from Jedediah, who informs him that the monkey Dexter stole the tablet and took it to the Smithsonian, bringing the exhibit there to life as well. Hearing sounds of fighting and chaos as someone pulls Jed away from the phone, Larry travels to Washington, DC, and navigates his way to the archives while posing as a night guard, with external help from his son Nick. As it is still daytime, Larry finds his friends trapped in their shipping container while under attack from the army of Ahkmenrah's evil older brother Kahmunrah. Larry attempts to pry the tablet out of Dexter's hands, but right as he gets it, the sun goes down, the tablet activates, and the exhibits in the Smithsonian come to life again. Kahmunrah locks Larry's friends in the shipping container and reveals his plans to use the tablet's powers to conquer the world. However, Larry escapes with the aid of a gigantic octopus and a wax model of General George A. Custer, although the latter is captured and imprisoned with Larry's friends. Then, a wax model of the adventurous Amelia Earhart becomes Larry's travelling companion around the museum as they try to figure out a way to rescue the others. The two evade Kahmunrah's army, eventually trapping them in the photograph of V-J Day in Times Square. Meanwhile, Kahmunrah enlists a trio of evil historical leaders — Ivan the Terrible, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Al Capone — to help capture Larry and retrieve the tablet. Jedediah and Octavius escape the shipping container, but Jed is re-captured and placed in an hourglass while Octavius manages to make it outside. Kahmunrah is unable to open his Gate of the Underworld without the tablet, so he gives Larry and Amelia an hour to translate it, otherwise he will kill Larry and his friends, starting with Jed trapped in the hourglass. Larry and Amelia's friendship increases to the point where she develops a crush on him and ends up kissing him as three flying sculptures of Cupid look on while singing love songs. Larry and Amelia decide to go to the National Air and Space Museum to find help, briefly encountering the statue of Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial, who confuses them for a couple. Meanwhile, Octavius makes it to the White House in an attempt to get help, but he is dragged away by a squirrel. Inside the Air and Space Museum, Larry has to ground all of the aircraft and rockets from taking off, before a group of Albert Einstein bobbleheads inform him that the combination he is looking for is the value of pi. Amelia tries to convince Larry for them to be a couple, but Larry struggles to tell her the truth that she is made of wax, so they cannot be together. Napoleon, Ivan, and Capone's troops arrive, prompting Larry and Amelia to escape using the Wright Flyer. They crash the plane into the Smithsonian, where Kahmunrah uses the acquired combination to summon an army of Horus warriors. However, Octavius arrives and interrupts the process, having tamed the squirrel. Kahmunrah scoffs due to his small size, but then Octavius reveals that he did bring help as the statue of Lincoln crashes in through the window and frightens the warriors back into the Underworld. Lincoln cryptically reminds Larry that "a house divided against itself cannot stand," and then returns to the Memorial. As a frustrated Kahmunrah orders his allies to kill Larry and Jed anyway, Amelia gathers an army of allies including Larry's friends, Custer, and the other museum exhibits they had encountered, leading to a climactic battle. At first, Kahmunrah's alliance is too powerful, and Larry finds Custer hiding behind a pile of treasure, ashamed that he led Larry's friends to another tragic defeat like the Battle of Little Big Horn. However, Larry persuades him to forget the past and fight for his new friends now. As Octavius rescues Jedediah, the tide of the battle starts to turn back in their favor. Larry obtains the tablet, and devises a plan to stop Kahmunrah. Inspired by Lincoln's quote, Larry sparks a disagreement between Capone, Bonaparte, and Ivan, causing them to brawl amongst themselves. Larry attempts to escape, only to be cut off by an angry Kahmunrah, brandishing a khopesh. After a brief yet dramatic scuffle between Kahmunrah and Larry, armed with his flashlight, Amelia eventually manages to use the tablet to open the gate, and Larry defeats Kahmunrah and throws him into the Underworld. Amelia flies Larry and the New York exhibits back home. Even though Larry does love Amelia, they both know she has to leave, knowing she will become dust before reaching the Smithsonian. However, the two share a final kiss before she takes off. Two months later, Larry sells his company, donating the money to the museum to renovate it and keep it open later into the night. All of the exhibits remain, capable of moving about at night under the pretense of being animatronics or hired re-enactors. Larry is rehired as a night guard and aids a woman named Tess who resembles Amelia during the debut of the museum's new extension of visiting hours.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 45% "rotten" approval rating, based on 168 reviews, with an average score of 5.17/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Night at the Museum: Battle at the Smithsonian is busy enough to keep the kids interested but the slapstick goes overboard and the special effects (however well executed) throw the production into mania".[16] Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, gave the film an average score of 42 out of 100 based on 31 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[17] Despite mixed reviews from critics, most critics praised Amy Adams' and Hank Azaria's performances. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune awarded the film 3 stars stating that "[Adams]'s terrific -- a sparkling screen presence."[18] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+ stating "Battle of the Smithsonian has plenty of life. But it's Adams who gives it zing."[19] Also, many reviews noted the costume worn by Amy Adams during the movie.[20] Perry Seibert of TV Guide gave the film 2 stars despite honoring that "thanks to Azaria, a master of comic timing. His grandiose, yet slightly fey bad guy is equally funny when he's chewing out minions as he is when deliberating if Oscar the Grouch and Darth Vader are evil enough to join his team.[21] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter and A.O. Scott of The New York Times enjoyed both performances.[22][23] One critic panned the movie on its excessive use of special effects as noted by Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club when he described the film as "a baffling master plot and a crowded pileup of special effects in search of something to do."[24] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times awarded the film 1½ stars out of 4 claiming "its premise is lame, its plot relentlessly predictable, its characters with personalities that would distinguish picture books."[25] In CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.[26] Accolades[edit] List of awards and nominations Year Award / Film Festival Category Recipient(s) Result Ref. 2009 Teen Choice Award Choice Movie: Comedy Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian Won [27] Choice Movie Actor: Comedy Ben Stiller Nominated [28] Choice Movie Actress: Comedy Amy Adams Nominated Choice Movie: Villain Hank Azaria Nominated 2010 MTV Movie Award Best Comedic Performance Ben Stiller Nominated People's Choice Awards Favorite Family Movie Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian Nominated Visual Effects Society Awards Outstanding Models and Miniatures in a Feature Motion Picture Ian Hunter, Forest Fischer, Robert Chapin, Tony Chen for the "National Air and Space Museum Escape" Nominated Home media[edit] Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian was made available December 1, 2009 on DVD and Blu-ray as a two-disc Special Edition and a three-disc Digital Copy Edition.[29] As of 12 February 2015[update], the film has sold 4,083,829 DVDs and 585,023 Blu-ray discs grossing $51,481,903 and $11,674,546 totalling $63,156,449 in North America.[30] In other media[edit] Video game Main article: Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (video game) The video game based on the film was released on May 5, 2009.

Sequel[edit] Main article: Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb Ben Stiller admitted that a sequel was "a possibility" and on January 22, 2010, co-writer Thomas Lennon said to Access Hollywood, "That after the success of two Night at the Museum films, it's no surprise that 20th Century Fox is looking to develop a third and that those suspicions are indeed true and how could you not? I think it's a really outstanding idea to do Night at the Museum 3, in fact," he said. "I wonder if someone's not even already working on a script for that," he added with a raised eyebrow. "I cannot confirm that for a fact, but I cannot deny it for a fact either... It might be in the works." In an interview, Stiller confirmed the sequel, however, he said that it was only in the "ideas stage".[31] It was announced in February 2013 that the film, directed by Shawn Levy, would be released on December 25, 2014.[32] On September 10, 2013, it was announced that shooting would start in February 2014.[33] On November 8, 2013, English actor Dan Stevens was cast as Sir Lancelot.[34] On November 15, 2013, it was announced Skyler Gisondo would be replacing Jake Cherry for the role of Nicky Daley.[35] On December 18, 2013 it was announced that Robin Williams, Stiller, and Ricky Gervais would be returning for the sequel.[36] On January 9, 2014, it was announced that Rebel Wilson would play a security guard in the British Museum.[37] On January 14, 2014, the film's release date was moved up from December 25, 2014, to December 19, 2014.[38] On January 23, 2014, it was announced Ben Kingsley would play an Egyptian Pharaoh at the British Museum.[39] Principal photography and production began on January 27, 2014.[citation needed] In May 2014, principal photography ended.[40] References[edit] ^ a b c "Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009)".
