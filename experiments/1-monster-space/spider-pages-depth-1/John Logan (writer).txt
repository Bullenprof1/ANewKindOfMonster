His parents immigrated to the United States from Northern Ireland via Canada.[citation needed] The youngest of three children, he has an older brother and sister. Logan grew up in California and Millburn, New Jersey, where he graduated from Millburn High School in 1979.[1] He moved to Chicago to attend Northwestern University, where he graduated in 1983.[2] Career[edit] Logan was a successful playwright in Chicago for many years before turning to screenwriting. His first play, Never the Sinner, tells the story of the infamous Leopold and Loeb case. Subsequent plays include Hauptmann, about the Lindbergh baby kidnapping, and Riverview, a musical melodrama set at Chicago's famed amusement park. His play Red, about artist Mark Rothko, was produced by the Donmar Warehouse, London, in December 2009,[3] and on Broadway in 2010, where it received six Tony Awards, the most of any play, including best play, best direction of a play for Michael Grandage and best featured actor in a play for Eddie Redmayne. Redmayne and Alfred Molina had originated their roles in London and also performed on Broadway, for a limited run ending in late June.[4] Logan wrote Any Given Sunday and the television film RKO 281, before gaining an Academy Award nomination for co-writing (with David Franzoni and William Nicholson) the Best Picture winner Gladiator in 2000. He received another nomination for writing The Aviator (2004), starring Leonardo DiCaprio and directed by Martin Scorsese. Other notable films written by Logan include Star Trek: Nemesis, The Time Machine, The Last Samurai, and the Tim Burton musical Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, for which he received a Golden Globe Award. Logan's feature films include Rango, an animated feature starring Johnny Depp and directed by Gore Verbinski; the film adaptation of Shakespeare's Coriolanus, directed by and starring Ralph Fiennes; Hugo, an adaptation of the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret, directed by Martin Scorsese; and the James Bond film Skyfall, along with Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. He wrote the Bond film, Spectre (2015). Two plays by Logan premiered in 2013; Peter and Alice, directed by Michael Grandage and starring Judi Dench and Ben Whishaw opened in London at the Noël Coward Theatre on March 25, 2013 and I'll Eat You Last: A Chat with Sue Mengers, directed by Joe Mantello and starring Bette Midler, opened on Broadway at the Booth Theatre on April 24, 2013.[5] He also created the 2014 television series Penny Dreadful starring Josh Hartnett, Eva Green and Timothy Dalton, for which he served as sole writer until it concluded with its third season. In November 2015, Logan was reported to have rewritten the script for Alien: Covenant.[6][7] During the audio commentary of Alien: Covenant, Scott mentions that Logan has already started writing Alien: Covenant 2.[8] In November 2018, it was announced that Showtime would produce a follow-up to the 2014 television series Penny Dreadful entitled Penny Dreadful: City of Angels, which takes place in Los Angeles in 1938. Logan will again be creator, executive producer, and sole writer for the show, which is set to premiere in 2020. Superhero, a new musical by Logan and Tom Kitt, had its world premiere production Off-Broadway at Second Stage Theatre, with an official opening night on February 28, 2019.[9] In November 2019, it was reported that Bohemian Rhapsody producer Graham King is planning to produce a Michael Jackson biopic, with the screenplay written by Logan.[10] Filmography[edit] Year Title Writer Producer Director Notes 1999 Bats Yes Executive Louis Morneau Any Given Sunday Yes No Oliver Stone Co-wrote with Oliver Stone and Daniel Pyne 2000 Gladiator Yes No Ridley Scott Co-wrote with David Franzoni and William Nicholson Nominated- Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay Nominated- BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay Nominated- Las Vegas Film Critics Society Awards for Best Original Screenplay 2002 The Time Machine Yes Co-producer Simon Wells Star Trek: Nemesis Yes No Stuart Baird Co-wrote with Rick Berman and Brent Spiner 2003 Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas Yes No Tim Johnson Patrick Gilmore The Last Samurai Yes No Edward Zwick Co-wrote with Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz 2004 The Aviator Yes No Martin Scorsese Nominated- Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay Nominated- BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay Nominated- Broadcast Film Critics Association for Best Writer Nominated- Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay Nominated- Satellite Award for Best Original Screenplay Nominated- Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay 2007 Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street Yes Yes Tim Burton Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy 2011 Rango Yes No Gore Verbinski Co-wrote with Gore Verbinski and James Ward Byrkit Annie Award for Writing in a Feature Production Coriolanus Yes Yes Ralph Fiennes Hugo Yes No Martin Scorsese Nominated- Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay Nominated- Alliance of Women Film Journalists for Best Adapted Screenplay Nominated- Broadcast Film Critics Association for Best Adapted Screenplay Nominated- Chicago Film Critics Association for Best Adapted Screenplay Nominated- Phoenix Film Critics Society for Best Adapted Screenplay Nominated- San Diego Film Critics Society Award for Best Adapted Screenplay Nominated- WAFCA for Best Adapted Screenplay Nominated- Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay 2012 Skyfall Yes No Sam Mendes Co-wrote with Neal Purvis and Robert Wade 2014 Jamie Marks Is Dead No Executive Carter Smith 2015 Spectre Yes No Sam Mendes Co-wrote with Jez Butterworth, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade 2016 Genius Yes Yes Michael Grandage 2017 Alien: Covenant Yes No Ridley Scott Co-wrote with Dante Harper Television[edit] Year Title Writer Executive Producer Notes 1996 Tornado!
