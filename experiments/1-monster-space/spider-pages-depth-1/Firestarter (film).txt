While the other participants suffer side-effects like headaches and twitches, the experiment gives Vicky and Andy telepathic abilities; Vicky can read minds and Andy can control others to do and believe what he wants, though the effort sometimes gives him nosebleeds ("pinprick" hemorrhages), limiting this power which is otherwise very strong. Andy and Vicky, now married, have a nine-year-old daughter named Charlene "Charlie" McGee (Barrymore), who has pyrokinetic abilities (the power to control heat and fire) and can also see the near future. Andy comes home from work and finds Vicky murdered and Charlie abducted; the family had already suspected that the government agency that sponsored the experiment, the Department of Scientific Intelligence ("the Shop"), was watching them. The government wants to weaponize Charlie's power. Andy finds Charlie and rescues her by blinding the agents. For the next year they are on the run. To protect themselves, Andy writes letters to major newspapers, but he unintentionally reveals their location. A farmer named Irv Manders (Carney) and his wife Norma (Fletcher) take in Andy and Charlie. Andy tells Irv the truth so that when the Shop arrives, he is ready to stand with them. However, Charlie quickly dispatches the agents when they arrive. They go on the run again, but Andy's power has weakened. They go to a secluded cabin and prepare to go public with their story. Unfortunately, the head of the Shop, Captain James Hollister (Sheen), sends agent and assassin John Rainbird (Scott) to capture them and stop the release of information. After capture, father and daughter are kept separated. Andy is medicated and subjected to tests, which show his powers have decreased. Meanwhile, Rainbird pretends to be "John", a friendly orderly employed by The Shop to gain Charlie's trust and encourage her to submit to the tests. Charlie's powers increase exponentially. She continually demands to see her father as they promised. Andy is revealed to be faking the acceptance of his drugs, so his powers have never decreased and it was all a ruse to make Hollister drop his guard. Once alone on a walk far from the house, Andy uses his power to get information from Hollister (such as "John"'s true identity) and arranges to leave with Charlie that night. He slips Charlie a note and she immediately tells John/Rainbird about the escape. Since he has wanted to kill Charlie since first hearing about her he hides in the barn so he can kill Andy as well. Charlie enters the barn first and John/Rainbird succeeds in convincing her to begin the climb up the ladder to him. His plan is put to an end once Andy enters and Charlie instead runs to her father. She tells him that "John" is present and asks if they can take him with them. She is saddened and angered to find out the truth, yet believes John/Rainbird when he states that he will not kill her father if she comes to him. To save his daughter, Andy orders the still mind-controlled Hollister to shoot at Rainbird. However, Rainbird kills Hollister, after which Andy, using his powers, causes Rainbird to leap to the ground, breaking his leg. Rainbird shoots Andy in the neck, fatally wounding him. He then fires at Charlie but she detonates the bullet and engulfs Rainbird in the following fire, killing him. Andy, mortally wounded and dying pleads with her to use her powers to bring the facility down after he dies. The entire security team arrives and she eliminates them one by one with her fire powers and makes her way off the property. Charlie hitchhikes back to the Manders' farm and is welcomed back. Shortly after, Charlie and Irv arrive in New York City to tell her story to the media. Cast[edit] David Keith as Andrew "Andy" McGee Drew Barrymore as Charlene "Charlie" McGee Freddie Jones as Dr. Joseph Wanless Heather Locklear as Victoria "Vicky" McGee (née Tomlinson) Martin Sheen as Captain James Hollister George C. Scott as John Rainbird Art Carney as Irv Manders Louise Fletcher as Norma Manders Moses Gunn as Dr. Herman Pynchot Antonio Fargas as Taxi Driver Production[edit] During filming of The Thing, Universal offered John Carpenter the chance to direct the film. Carpenter hired Bill Lancaster to adapt the novel into a screenplay, which Stephen King approved of.[5] Months later, Carpenter hired Bill Phillips to write another version with Richard Dreyfuss as Andy, but when The Thing underperformed financially, Universal replaced Carpenter with Mark L. Lester, who brought Stanley Mann to write a screenplay that stayed closer to the novel than the abandoned screenplays that Carpenter had commissioned. Lancaster's father, Burt Lancaster, originally was going to portray Captain Hollister, but had to withdraw following heart surgery; Martin Sheen replaced Lancaster.[6][7] The film was shot in and around the city of Wilmington, North Carolina from September 12 to November 26, 1983.[8] It was the first film to be shot there after the commission of the North Carolina Film Office, and it is regarded as launching the city as what is now a burgeoning hub of film and television productions.[9] Reception[edit] Firestarter has a 37% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 27 reviews. The critical consensus reads, "Firestarter's concept hews too closely to other known Stephen King adaptations, though it's got nice special effects (including scenery-chewing George C. Scott)."[10] Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four, and wrote, "the most astonishing thing" about it was "how boring it is...there's not a character in this movie that is convincing, even for a moment, nor a line in this movie that even experienced performers can make real;" and, "we don't feel sorry for Barrymore because she's never developed as a believable little girl -- just a plot gimmick."[11] After seeing a rough cut, Stephen King declared it “One of the worst of the bunch” of the adaptations of his work he had seen, and dubbed it “flavourless.” He and director Mark Lester later traded barbs over the comments, though King told Cinefantastique he feels Firestarter’s producer is the one to blame for its failings.[12][13] Colin Greenland reviewed Firestarter for Imagine magazine, and stated that " I suspect the story was ruined before it ever got to the actors: spoilt by oversimplification and the surgical removal of all King's narrative intelligence. The great final conflagration comes as a relief. Yet another movie with all its conviction reserved for the special effects."[14] Soundtrack[edit] Firestarter 1984 LP album cover Soundtrack album by Tangerine Dream Released July 1984 Recorded 1984 Genre Electronic music Length 41:39 Label MCA Tangerine Dream chronology Risky Business (1984) Firestarter (1984) Flashpoint (1984) Firestarter is the twenty-second major release and fifth soundtrack album by the German electronic music group Tangerine Dream.
