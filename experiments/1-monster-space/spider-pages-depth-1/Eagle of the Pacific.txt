The studio used storyboarding to plan the visual effects sequences, a technique they would repeat on Godzilla.[3] One scene required a Zero fighter plane and its pilot to catch fire. The pilot was played by a stuntman named Haruo Nakajima, who Honda later cast as Godzilla.[1] Reception[edit] Eagle of the Pacific grossed 163 million yen, the third highest total for a Japanese film in 1953.[4] Release[edit] The film was released on DVD in Japan in 2005.[5] References[edit] ^ a b Brothers, Peter (2009).
