Melpomene by Joseph Fagnani (1819–1873) (1869) In Greek mythology, Melpomene (/mɛlˈpɒmɪniː/; Ancient Greek: Μελπομένη, romanized: Melpoménē, lit. 'to sing' or 'the one that is melodious'), initially the muse of chorus, eventually became the muse of tragedy, and is now best known in that association.[1] Contents 1 Etymology 2 Appearance 3 Family 4 Mythology 5 See also 6 Notes 7 References 8 External links Etymology[edit] Melpomene's name was derived from the Greek verb melpô or melpomai meaning "to celebrate with dance and song." Appearance[edit] Melpomene is often represented with a tragic mask and wearing the cothurnus, boots traditionally worn by tragic actors. Often, she also holds a knife or club in one hand and the tragic mask in the other. Family[edit] Melpomene is the daughter of Zeus and Mnemosyne.[2][3][4] Her sisters include Calliope (muse of epic poetry), Clio (muse of history), Euterpe (muse of lyrical poetry), Terpsichore (muse of dancing), Erato (muse of erotic poetry), Thalia (muse of comedy), Polyhymnia (muse of hymns), and Urania (muse of astronomy). She is also the mother of several of the Sirens,[5][6][7] the divine handmaidens of Kore (Persephone/Proserpina) who were cursed by her mother, Demeter/Ceres, when they were unable to prevent the kidnapping of Kore (Persephone/Proserpina) by Hades/Pluto. Mythology[edit] In Greek and Latin poetry since Horace (d. 8 BC), it was commonly auspicious to invoke Melpomene.[8] See also[edit] Muses in popular culture The Nine Muses Notes[edit] ^ Blyth, Charles (1990), Virgilian Tragedy and Troilus, 24, The Chaucer Review, pp. 211–218 ^ Hesiod, Theogony 77 ^ Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca historica 4.7.1 ^ Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1.3.1 ^ Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1.3.4 & Epitome 7.18 ^ Hyginus, Fabulae Preface, 125 & 141, ed.
