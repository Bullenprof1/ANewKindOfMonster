The Japan Fantasy Novel Award (日本ファンタジーノベル大賞, Nihon Fantashī Noberu Taishō) is an annual award which began in 1989 and is sponsored by the Yomiuri Shimbun and Shimizu Corporation with the backing of publisher Shinchōsha. The winner gets a contract to have their unpublished work published by Shinchōsha and receives ¥5 million. The contest is open to anyone, whether an already published author or not. Past winners include Riku Onda, Fuyumi Ono and Ken'ichi Sakemi. It ceased in being awarded after 2013, its twenty-fifth year,[1] but started again in 2017.
