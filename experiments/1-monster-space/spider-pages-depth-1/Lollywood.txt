In 1971 after the independence of Bangladesh it was fully shifted to Lahore. Since 2007, however, Karachi has largely overtaken Lahore in Urdu film productions. The word "Lollywood" was coined in the summer of 1989 in Glamour magazine as a portmanteau of "Lahore" and "Hollywood", published from Karachi, by gossip columnist Saleem Nasir.
