Child pages: Template:Greek myth (Titan) Template:Greek myth (Olympian) Template:Greek myth (Pan) - for matters rustic and ithyphallic Template:Greek myth (nymph) Template:Greek myth (Apollo) - Apolline stuff here Template:Greek myth (Dionysus) - Dionysiac here Template:Greek myth (sea) - everything aquatic Template:Greek myth (earth) - everything chthonic Template:Greek myth (abstract) - personified abstractions Template:Greek myth (Hades) - underworld and occupants Planned: Template:Greek myth (Troy) - war etc. Template:Greek myth (Oedipus) - incest and war Template:Greek myth (Minotaur) - Theseus, Minos, etc. Template:Greek myth (Argo) - Argonautica I dunno about Heracles and Perseus. Maybe. Bacchiad 15:40, 17 Jul 2004 (UTC) Are these necessary considering how we have categories now? They seem like unnecessary clutter. Postdlf 23:10, 17 Jul 2004 (UTC) I think you're mostly right. It was practicable and (I think) helpful with Roman myth. It's clearly breaking down with Greek myth, where things are much more open-ended and complex. Where something like nymphs or the figures associated with a god are loosely defined and wide-ranging and potentially hierarchical, categories are much better. So I'm mostly dissatisfied with the experiment. I decided not to press forward any more when I got to heroes and it became clear that even a Theseus/Minotaur box would be impossible to do well, let alone Trojan War. The ones that I think might be worth keeping, in stripped-down form, are Template:Greek myth (Titan) and Template:Greek myth (Olympian) - maybe or maybe not (sea) and (Hades). The first two sets, at least, are small, heterogeneous and closely-interrelated enough where it could still work. I'll continue to tinker. One way or another, the clutter will be alleviated.
