Pillsbury Doughboy First appearance November 7, 1965[1] Created by Rudy Perz Voiced by Paul Frees (1965–1986) Jeff Bergman (1986–2013) JoBe Cerny (2013–present) In-universe information Alias Poppin' Fresh Gender Male Title Mascot of Pillsbury Company Poppin' Fresh, more widely known as the Pillsbury Doughboy, is an advertising mascot for the Pillsbury Company, appearing in many of their commercials. Many commercials from 1965 until 2005 (together with some for GEICO between 2009 and 2017) concluded with a human finger poking the Doughboy's stomach. The Doughboy responds when his stomach is poked by giggling (Hoo-Hoo!, or earlier on, a slight giggle "tee hee").[1] Contents 1 History 2 Pillsbury family 3 Trademark conflict 4 Cultural references 5 References 6 External links History[edit] The Pillsbury Doughboy was created by Rudy Pers, a copywriter for Pillsbury's longtime advertising agency Leo Burnett.[2] Perz was sitting in his kitchen in the spring of 1965, under pressure to create an advertising campaign for Pillsbury's refrigerated dough product line (biscuits, dinner rolls, sweet rolls, and cookies). His copywriter, Carol H. Williams, imagined a living doughboy popping out of a Pillsbury Crescent Rolls can and wrote the campaign, "Say Hello to Poppin' Fresh Dough". Originally named "Jonathan Pillsbury,"[citation needed] the dough boy was given a scarf, a chef's hat, and two big blue eyes to distinguish him from the rolls, as well as a blush and a soft, warm chuckle when poked in the stomach. The Doughboy was originally designed by Milt Schaffer and brought to life using stop motion clay animation. Today, CGI is used. The first CGI commercial was broadcast in 1992 and was directed by Tim Johnson who at that time was working for PDI. Perz originally conceived the Doughboy as an animated figure but changed his mind after seeing a stop motion titling technique used in the opening credits for The Dinah Shore Show. A three-dimensional Doughboy puppet was then created at a cost of $16,000. Voice actor Paul Frees was chosen to be Fresh's voice.[3] Stop-motion animator George Pal was hired to animate him. The first Poppin' Fresh commercials aired in November 1965. Since then, Pillsbury has used Poppin' Fresh in more than 600 commercials for more than fifty of its products. He also appeared in a Mastercard commercial, with the Jolly Green Giant, the Morton Salt Girl, the Vlasic stork, and Count Chocula, as some of the ten merchandising icons, depicted as having dinner together. He even appears in deleted ads for the Got Milk? company and the Sprint Phone Company, and the GEICO insurance company. He also made a cameo appearance in the 1987 claymation film The Puppetoon Movie. After Frees' death in 1986, Jeff Bergman took over the role, until 2013.[1] Today, the high-pitched giggles are done by JoBe Cerny.[4] Pillsbury family[edit] In the 1970s, a Pillsbury Doughboy family was created and sold as dolls individually and in the form of various playsets.[5] Included in the family are: Poppin' Fresh[5] Poppie Fresh (a.k.a. Mrs. Poppin' Fresh, Pillsbury Doughgirl). It is debated among collectors as to whether Poppie is Poppin's wife, girlfriend, or sister.[6][5] Granpopper and Granmommer (grandparents)[5] Popper (boy) and Bun-Bun (baby, girl)[5] Flapjack (dog) and Biscuit (cat)[5] Uncle Rollie[5] Trademark conflict[edit] In May 2010, Pillsbury's lawyers served a cease and desist notice to My Dough Girl, LLC., a Salt Lake City, Utah cookie retailer.[7] Some reported that an attorney for General Mills instructed her not to talk to the press.[8] Cultural references[edit] The comic strip B.C. had February 18 2021 a hunting scene with Peter poking Doughboy's stomach with a spear, who giggled "Hee hee" instead.[9] References[edit] ^ a b c "How Well Do You Know the Pillsbury Doughboy?".
