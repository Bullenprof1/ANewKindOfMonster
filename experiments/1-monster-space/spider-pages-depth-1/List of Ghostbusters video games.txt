It was designed by David Crane, produced by Brad Fregger, and released for several home computer platforms in 1984, and later released for various video game console systems, including the Atari 2600, Sega Master System and NES. Ghostbusters (Activision) on the Commodore 64 (1984). Most versions of the game have a similar basic format to the initial Commodore 64 and Atari 800 game, which Crane wrote in six weeks. He based it in part on an incomplete game called Car Wars featuring armed automobiles in a city; this led, for example, to the "ghost vacuum" on the Ecto-1, something not present in the film. Activision obtained the license early in the film's production, and most of the game was finished by the time Crane watched the film. While pleased with the game, Crane later stated that he regretted not being able to include a better victory screen.[1] The last week of development was spent on the opening screen which plays the Ghostbusters theme song.[2] The game was later ported to the Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX, and Atari 2600. The game starts with a choice between four drivable cars, and the player must stock up on equipment and make money to complete their objectives. Upon completion of the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Atari 8-bit, Amstrad CPC, Sega Master System and MSX versions of the game, a code was provided that allowed the player to start a new game with the amount of money accumulated by the end of the previous game. This allowed accelerated progression in the new game. The game varied in some respects depending upon which platform it was played; the Sega Master System version (1987) added an on-foot shooting gallery level with different animations, while the NES version (1988), ported by Japanese developer Bits Laboratory, made the action sequences considerably more difficult, had lower graphical resolution and provided a different ending. The new ending in the NES version is full of spelling, grammar and punctuation mistakes:[1] CONGLATURATION !!! YOU HAVE COMPLETED A GREAT GAME. AND PROOVED THE JUSTICE OF OUR CULTURE. NOW GO AND REST OUR HEROES ! This ending text can also be seen on a monitor in the Firehouse in Ghostbusters: The Video Game. The Real Ghostbusters (1987), arcade game[edit] Main article: The Real Ghostbusters (1987 video game) The arcade version of The Real Ghostbusters (1987). The Real Ghostbusters is an arcade game based on the cartoon series of the same name. It was released by Japanese game company Data East in 1987. The game was later ported to the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum. The game has a total of 10 levels. In Japan, the arcade version is known as Meikyūu Hunter G (迷宮ハンターG, Labyrinth Hunter G), and does not use the Ghostbusters license.[3] The game went to number 2 in the UK sales charts, behind Run the Gauntlet.[4] Ghostbusters II video game[edit] Ghostbusters II is the title of a video game released for several home computer and console systems. The game is loosely based on the film of the same name. Computer versions[edit] Main article: Ghostbusters II (computer video game) The home computer editions were published by Activision; each edition is essentially similar, although the DOS version is completely different from the other ones, having been developed by a different company, Dynamix, with game design by Doug Barnett. Each version of the game includes a level in which the Statue of Liberty is controlled by the player. Each version also includes a final battle with Vigo the Carpathian. The DOS version begins with a level in which the Ghostbusters battle the Scoleri brothers in a courtroom, as in the film. If the player loses a challenge, the player's Ghostbuster character is institutionalized in a mental ward but can be rescued by one of the other Ghostbusters.[5] The other computer versions of the game feature three levels based on scenes from the film.[6] Activision NES version[edit] Main article: Ghostbusters II (NES video game) Activision's NES edition of the game is a single-player side-scrolling game where the player controls a Ghostbuster through various stages based on the film, making their way to the museum before time runs out. Two levels involves riding around in the heroes' famous car and another level requires the player to control the Statue of Liberty, shooting fireballs. The game was noted for being exceptionally hard to complete. New Ghostbusters II[edit] Main article: New Ghostbusters II A version of the game was released in Europe and Japan for the NES and Game Boy, titled New Ghostbusters II, developed by HAL Laboratory. It is more of a straightforward action game than the Activision game. The Game Boy version was released in America without the New label. Notable for allowing players to choose from all five ghostbusters from the end of the film; Peter, Ray, Egon, Winston, and Louis Tully. Atari 2600 version[edit] Activision made a version of the game for the Atari 2600 in 1989, late in the console's market lifespan. Activision never released the game. British game company Salu released the game in Europe under its name in 1992, after Atari had already ended support for the 2600 system. Licensing issues have prevented this version of the game from being included on the Activision Anthology collections, along with a few other titles.[citation needed] Ghostbusters (1990), Mega Drive/Genesis[edit] Main article: Ghostbusters (1990 video game) Ghostbusters was developed and published by Sega for the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1990. It is unrelated to Activision's initial Ghostbusters game, and is instead a platform shoot 'em up game in which the player chooses to play as one of three Ghostbusters from the films; Winston Zeddemore is excluded from the game. Four levels are available initially; after they are completed, a fifth level is unlocked, followed by a sixth and final level. Each level contains a number (usually two) of mid-bosses known as "middle ghosts"; after a middle ghost is defeated, it turns into a small green ghost which can be captured for extra money by luring it over a ghost trap. Between levels, money can be used to buy powerups, such as a 3-way shot or recovery items. The Ghostbusters are down on their luck due to lack of ghost activity, when suddenly several calls begin to pour in from around the city, including the eventual reappearance of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man (although dialogue indicates it is not the same one from the movie). After each case, a piece of a stone tablet is collected. The three Ghostbusters piece together the mysterious tablet, inadvertently opening a portal to "the evil world" and releasing a horde of ghosts. In the end, though, the Ghostbusters manage to defeat Janna, the God of Darkness, and retrieve a mystical gem from the evil world. They combine the gem with the tablet to close the portal, and save the city. The Real Ghostbusters (1993), Game Boy[edit] Main article: The Real Ghostbusters (1993 video game) The 1993 The Real Ghostbusters game was developed by Kemco and published in North America by Activision for the Game Boy. In it, the player played as Peter Venkman. The game is based on Kemco's Crazy Castle franchise and features similar puzzle-oriented gameplay. This game was released in Europe as Garfield Labyrinth and in Japan as Mickey Mouse IV: Mahou no Labyrinth (ミッキーマウスIV 魔法のラビリンス, lit. "Mickey Mouse IV: The Magical Labyrinth"), which features different characters and licenses for both versions.

Ghostbusters (2006), mobile[edit] A top down puzzle game was released in 2006 for cell phones on Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Cingular (now AT&T) networks. The story revolves around the Ghostbusters being hired by a millionaire tycoon to rid his home of ghosts, but the story does not go beyond that with no cut scenes or dialog during the game. Ultimately, Ghostbusters mobile was panned critically due to its extreme length (over 100 rooms to enter), plain gameplay design (gathering colored keys, pushing statues, activating switches), and no real references to any of the original Ghostbusters characters or movies, besides the opening theme music.[10] Ghostbusters: The Video Game (2009)[edit] Main article: Ghostbusters: The Video Game Ghostbusters: The Video Game is a video game for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS and PC.
