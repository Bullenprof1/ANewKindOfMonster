(1975), which featured Seijun Suzuki, receiving particularly high praise.[3] His script "Orenji rōdo kyūkō" won the 3rd Kido Award for screenplays in 1977, and the next year he was able to film that in his professional debut.[1] Several of his films, such as the 1980 Hipokuratesu-tachi, feature doctors or rely on his knowledge of medicine.
