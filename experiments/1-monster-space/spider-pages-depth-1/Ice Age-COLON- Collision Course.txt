Diego and his wife Shira want to start a family, but their fierce appearance tends to scare children. Sid is dumped by his girlfriend, Francine, just as he is about to propose to her, and he laments his solitude. During Manny and Ellie's twenty-third wedding anniversary party, asteroids strike the place and The Herd barely escape. Meanwhile, at the underground lost world, Buck returns a Chasmosaurus egg back to its rightful owner after it was stolen by a trio of flying dromaeosaurs named Gavin, Gertie, and Roger. Buck discovers an ancient stone pillar and takes it to the surface, where he meets The Herd after 21 years. Buck explains to The Herd that according to the pillar, the asteroids had caused two extinctions of "horseshoe crab-looking thingies" and dinosaurs in the past and with a massive one still incoming, he believes that the only place they could find a clue to stop it is on the site of the impact of the previous ones, as according to its engravings, they always fall at the same place. However, the three dromaeosaurs overhear their conversation, and Gavin and Gertie decide to stop them, believing that they could easily avoid the impact, thus not only getting their revenge on Buck, but also eradicating Earth's population and securing domination over the planet for their species. Roger is reluctant, but Gavin and Gertie strong-arm him into cooperating. As The Herd travels to the crash site, they discover that the asteroids have electro-magnetic properties. Buck theorizes that if a huge quantity of smaller asteroids should be gathered and launched into orbit, they could attract the main asteroid as well and prevent it from falling on Earth. After facing several obstacles and the interference of the dromaeosaurs, The Herd arrives at "Geotopia", a community of immortal animals formed inside one of the asteroids that have fallen long ago, where Sid meets Brooke, a female ground sloth who falls in love with him. However, Shangri Llama, the leader of Geotopia, refuses to cooperate with Buck's plan to send the city's crystals into space in order to prevent the imminent impact, as they are the key to the residents' longevity. Sid inadvertently destroys the entire city when he attempts to remove one of the crystals to present Brooke with, immediately aging them to their real ages and revealing their true crone-like appearances, much to Shangri Llama's anger. Once Brooke convinces the Geotopians that preventing the asteroid's fall is more important than their lost youth, they and The Herd help with Buck's plan, which is to fill up a volcano with the crystals so that the pressure launches them into space to draw the asteroid away. The dromaeosaurs attempt to intervene, but they soon discover that they will not be able to survive the asteroid's impact, and Buck convinces them to help. The plan initially fails, as there is a small leak Granny discovers, who uses her cane to plug it up, causing an explosion, and the asteroid is pulled back into space. The Herd then departs back home, including Sid, who parts ways from Brooke, but just after they leave, a small crystal shard falls inside a hot spring, giving it rejuvenating properties and making the Geotopians and Granny, who stayed behind with them, regain their youth. After The Herd returns, Manny reconciles with Julian, Peaches and Julian celebrate their wedding, Diego and Shira become heroes to the kids who were scared of them before, and a rejuvenated Brooke appears during the ceremony to reunite with Sid.

They were then sent to be hand-sculpted with clay, and ultimately scanned into CGI software and animated around the model.[19] The "Figaro's Aria" sequence which involved Buck saving an egg from a trio of dromaeosaurs proved to be one of the most challenging sequences for Blue Sky Studios' animators, as it involved a continuous uninterrupted shot that ran for around two minutes long. It was one of the first scenes put into production but also one of the last to exit production due to its time-consuming and difficult structure, as the team would only be able to produce three or four seconds of footage a week. The recording session took place in Los Angeles, California since most of the actors live there while the studio is based in New York City. Director Mike Thurmeier and co-director Galen T. Chu would take turns travelling to L.A. to head the recording sessions.[21] In the film, Simon Pegg sang a rendition of "Figaro".[21] Jesse Tyler Ferguson was offered the role after the producers saw his performance in Modern Family. It is his first time working in an animated film.[22] Ferguson blew out his voice on the first day of the recording session because he did a lot of yelling. He then took a few days off and came back later to finish his part.[22] He admitted that he struggled the first time he heard his voice come out of his character's mouth. As a result, he decided to stop watching interviews of himself on television because he found them to be "too weird".[22] A promotional poster, shown in June 2015, at the Licensing Expo, revealed the film's full title: Ice Age: Collision Course.[23] Soundtrack[edit] Ice Age: Collision Course Film score by John Debney Released July 19, 2016 Recorded 2016 Genre Score Label Varèse Sarabande Producer John Debney John Debney film scores chronology Mother's Day (2016) Ice Age: Collision Course (2016) League of Gods (2016) The film was composed by John Debney, who replaced John Powell from the previous three films due to Powell being busy with other projects.[7] However, most of Powell's score from the third film was included, along with David Newman's score from the first film. Jessie J performed a song dubbed "Superstar" as a contribution to the film. No. Title Length 1. "Ice Age: Collision Course Main Title" 0:15 2. "Cosmic Scrat-tastrophe" 2:42 3.

An extended sneak peek of the movie in the form of a short film called Cosmic Scrat-tastrophe was attached to theatrical showings of Blue Sky Studios' The Peanuts Movie on November 6, 2015.[26] The teaser poster of the film was revealed on November 6, 2015 with the words "Bring Scrat Home" spoofing The Martian.[27] The short film was released later on November 9, 2015, on 20th Century Fox's official YouTube page.[28] Home media[edit] Ice Age: Collision Course was released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on DVD, Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, 4K Blu-ray and digital download on October 11, 2016. Special features include a new short film titled Scrat: Spaced Out,[29] which is primarily made up of Scrat's scenes from the film, with a few unique scenes at the end. Ice Age: Collision Course was released on The Walt Disney Company's streaming service Disney+ on July 3, 2020. Cosmic Scrat-tastrophe[edit] Cosmic Scrat-tastrophe is a five-minute short film, with the majority of its footage, minus the closing scene, taken from the beginning of Ice Age: Collision Course.[30][31] Directed by Michael Thurmeier and Galen Chu, the short premiered on November 6, 2015, along with the film The Peanuts Movie.[26] In the short, Scrat, trying to bury his acorn, accidentally activates an abandoned alien ship that takes him into deep space, where he unwittingly sends several asteroids en route to a collision with Earth. Scrat: Spaced Out[edit] Scrat: Spaced Out is a short film that compiles all Scrat's scenes from Ice Age: Collision Course with a few unique scenes at the end.[32] The short was included on the film's home media releases.[29] Following the events of Ice Age: Collision Course, Scrat is heading back to Earth in the saucer. An acorn-shaped ship appears and pulls the acorn, with Scrat holding onto it. In the ship, three alien squirrels (A.K.A Scratzons) are surprised by finding Scrat, and blast him away from the acorn. Scrat tries to take it back with a tractor beam in a nearby saucer, but the alien leader pulls it back with another tractor beam. Being pulled to both sides, the nutrogen inside the acorn snaps, creating a massive explosion, which destroys the ship and creates a black hole sucking everything nearby into it. Scrat jumps out of the saucer, knocks the Scratzon alien leader into the black hole while trying to save the acorn, but gets pulled in the hole nonetheless. He emerges in space along with the acorn, only for the black hole appearing again, snatching the acorn and leaving Scrat alone again. Reception[edit] Box office[edit] Ice Age: Collision Course grossed $64 million in North America and $344 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $408 million, against a production budget of $105 million.[5] In terms of total earnings, its biggest markets outside of North America were China ($66 million) (with the country being also its largest territory overall), France ($26.3 million), Brazil ($25 million), Germany ($24.7 million) and Mexico ($22.2 million).[33] In the United States and Canada Ice Age: Collision Course opened on July 22, 2016, alongside Star Trek Beyond and Lights Out, and was projected to gross $30–35 million from 3,997 theaters in its opening weekend.[34] It made $850,000 from Thursday night previews and $7.8 million on its first day.[35] It had a $21 million debut in its opening weekend, finishing fourth at the box office. The film finished its theatrical run with a domestic gross of $64 million. Produced on a budget of $105 million, the film became the lowest-grossing film of the franchise as well as Blue Sky's lowest-grossing film, causing the film to become a box office bomb at the North American box office.[36][37][38] The film began its international theatrical run two weeks prior to its North American release, earning $18 million from seven markets on about 5,286 screens.[39] In its second weekend, it added $32.2 million from 25 countries. As a result, it only topped the international box office for a non-Chinese film but also helped Fox pass the $2 billion mark internationally, making this the eighth consecutive calendar year Fox has surpassed this milestone, and the 10th time in the studio's history.[40] The film came in third place overall, behind the two Chinese films Cold War 2 and Big Fish & Begonia.[41][42] By its third weekend, after grossing another $53.5 million from 15,132 screens in a total 51 markets, it finally topped the international box office and became the biggest grosser of the weekend.[43] It recorded the biggest opening of all time for Fox in Argentina ($3.77 million), where its debut is also the third-biggest of all time behind Furious 7 and Captain America: Civil War; Colombia ($2.18 million), Central America ($2.2 million), and Uruguay ($620,618); the second-biggest in Mexico ($8.4 million), behind Ice Age: Continental Drift; Peru, Chile, and Ecuador; the biggest opening among the series in Brazil ($4.5 million) and the biggest non-holiday animated opening ever in India ($1.66 million).[40][43] Elsewhere, it had No. 1 openings in Russia ($5.9 million), Italy ($4.5 million), Germany ($4.2 million), Austria ($893,350), and Switzerland ($514,789) and No. 5 in Australia ($3.1 million).[39][43] In France, it opened amidst the 2016 Nice truck attack and delivered an opening weekend of $7.1 million. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it debuted in second place with $5.2 million, behind Ghostbusters which also opened the same weekend.[43] In China, it opened on Tuesday, August 23, alongside Jason Bourne and delivered a six-day opening of $42.7 million and a Friday to Sunday debut of $23.1 million. The debut makes it the top non-local animated opening in the country that year and is also the franchise's best debut.[44][45][46] It has so far grossed a total of $63.6 million there.[47] Critical response[edit] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 18% based on 118 reviews and an average rating of 4.15/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Unoriginal and unfunny, Ice Age: Collision Course offers further proof that not even the healthiest box office receipts can keep a franchise from slouching toward creative extinction."[48] Rotten Tomatoes also ranks Collision Course as the worst-reviewed of all the five films in the Ice Age franchise.[49] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 34 out of 100 based on reviews from 27 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".[50] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.[37] Katie Walsh of Los Angeles Times gave the film a negative review, writing that "Collision Course is simply a perfunctory, watered-down entry in the series that feels like it should have been released on home video."[51] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film one out of four stars, saying, "The fifth entry in the Ice Age series is a loud, lazy, laugh-starved cash grab that cynically exploits its target audience (I use the term advisedly) by serving them scraps and calling it yummy."[52] Owen Gleiberman of Variety gave the film a positive review, saying that "The long-running series returns to form with an infectious chatterbox comedy about the end of the world as we know it."[2] Future[edit] Possible sequel[edit] On the possibility of a sequel, co-director Galen T. Chu stated in June 2016 that there were some ideas for the sixth installment.[21] In July 2016, Bustle noted that the chances of a sixth entry were relatively high but would depend on the box office performance of the fifth film.[53] The closure of Blue Sky Studios in 2021[54] put the possibility of a sixth film into uncertainty. Spin-off[edit] In October 2019, after the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, a spin-off was in development for Disney+.[55] The spin-off was officially confirmed to be a film, titled Ice Age: Adventures of Buck Wild and will centre around Buck going on an adventure in the Dinosaur World with Crash and Eddie. The film is set to release in early 2022 for the franchise's 20th anniversary.[56] References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i j Truitt, Brian (November 5, 2015).
