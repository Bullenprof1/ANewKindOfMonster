It tells the story of Jack Skellington, the King of "Halloween Town" who stumbles through a portal to "Christmas Town" and becomes obsessed with celebrating the holiday. Danny Elfman wrote the songs and score, and provided the singing voice of Jack.[9] The principal voice cast also includes Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickey, Ken Page, Paul Reubens, Glenn Shadix, and Ed Ivory. The Nightmare Before Christmas originated in a poem written by Burton in 1982 while he was working as an animator at Walt Disney Productions. With the success of Vincent in the same year, Burton began to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30-minute television special to no avail. Over the years, Burton's thoughts regularly returned to the project and in 1990, he made a development deal with Walt Disney Studios. Production started in July 1991 in San Francisco; Disney initially released the film through Touchstone Pictures because the studio believed the film would be "too dark and scary for kids".[4] The film met with both critical and financial success, grossing $91.5 million since its initial release and garnering a cult following. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, a first for an animated film. The film has since been reissued by Walt Disney Pictures, and was re-released annually in Disney Digital 3-D from 2006 until 2009, making it the first stop-motion animated feature to be entirely converted to 3D.

Jack Skellington, respected by the citizens as the "Pumpkin King", leads them in organizing the annual Halloween celebrations. However, privately Jack has grown weary of the same routine year after year and wants something new. Wandering in the woods the next morning, he stumbles across six trees containing doors leading to other towns representing various holidays, (Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas and Independence Day) and enters the one shaped like a Christmas tree, which leads into Christmas Town. Awed by the unfamiliar holiday, Jack returns to Halloween Town to show the residents his findings, but they fail to grasp the idea of Christmas and compare everything to their ideas of Halloween. However, they do relate to one Christmas Town character: its ruler, Santa Claus, as Jack mistakenly describes him as a malevolent being called "Sandy Claws". Jack sequesters himself in his tower to study Christmas and find a way to rationally explain it, but cannot. He ultimately decides that it is unfair for Christmas Town alone to enjoy the holiday and announces that he and the citizens of Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year. Jack assigns the citizens of Halloween Town Christmas-themed jobs, including singing carols, making presents, and building a sleigh to be pulled by skeletal reindeer. Sally, a beautiful rag doll woman who is secretly in love with Jack, experiences a vision that their efforts will end in disaster, but Jack dismisses this and assigns her the task of sewing him a red coat to wear. He also tasks Lock, Shock and Barrel, a trio of mischievous trick-or-treating children, to abduct Santa and bring him back to Halloween Town. Jack tells Santa he will be bringing Christmas to the world in his place this year. Jack orders the trio to keep Santa safe, but the children instead deliver Santa to Oogie Boogie, a gambling bogeyman, who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake. Sally attempts to rescue Santa so he can stop Jack, but Oogie captures her as well. Jack departs to deliver presents to Christmas Town, but the Halloween-styled gifts frighten the populace. While the media sends word via radio about the Santa impostor, the military shoots down Jack, causing him to crash in a cemetery. While the saddened residents of Halloween Town think he has been killed, Jack has in fact survived, and while he bemoans the disaster he has made of Christmas, he finds he enjoyed the experience nonetheless, reigniting his love of Halloween. But first, he realizes he must take action to fix his mess. Jack returns to Halloween Town and finds Oogie's lair. Oogie prepares to burn Sally and Santa in his cauldron and tries to kill Jack, but Jack defeats him by ripping apart a thread holding his cloth form together, causing all of the bugs that live inside Oogie to fall into the cauldron, burning them alive. Jack apologizes to Santa for his actions. Despite still being disappointed with Jack for ruining Christmas and not listening to Sally's warnings, Santa forgives Jack and assures him that he can fix things and takes his leave. As Santa replaces the Halloween-style presents with genuine ones, the townspeople of Halloween Town celebrate Jack's survival and return. Santa then visits Halloween Town and brings them a snowfall for the residents to play with, which, in a way, fulfills Jack's original dream. As he flies away, Santa shouts out "Happy Halloween!" and Jack replies by shouting "Merry Christmas!" as snow falls. In the graveyard, Jack and Sally declare their love for each other. Voice cast[edit] Main article: List of The Nightmare Before Christmas characters Chris Sarandon, the speaking voice of Jack Skellington Catherine O'Hara, the voice of Sally Chris Sarandon (speaking voice) and Danny Elfman (singing voice) as Jack Skellington, a skeleton known as the "Pumpkin King" of Halloween Town. He has a ghost dog named Zero, who has a small, glowing jack-o'-lantern nose. Elfman was initially cast as Jack's singing voice and, after the songs were recorded, Sarandon was cast to match Elfman's voice style.[10][11] Elfman also voices: Barrel, one of the trick-or-treaters working for Oogie Boogie. The Clown with the Tear-Away Face, the self-described clown who rides a unicycle. Catherine O'Hara as Sally, a rag doll/scarecrow-like creation of Finklestein and Jack's love interest. She is a toxicologist who uses various types of poison to liberate herself from the captivity of Finklestein. She is also psychic and has premonitions when anything bad is about to happen. O'Hara had previously co-starred in Burton's Beetlejuice (1988). O'Hara also voices Shock, one of the trick-or-treaters working for Oogie Boogie. William Hickey as Doctor Finklestein, a mad scientist and the "father" of Sally. He is listed in the credits only as "Evil Scientist" and is only mentioned by name once in the film. Glenn Shadix as Mayor of Halloween Town, an enthusiastic leader who conducts town meetings. His wild mood swings from happy to distraught because his head spins between a "happy" and "sad" face; where some career politicians are figuratively two-faced, the mayor is literally so. Burton and Shadix previously worked on Beetlejuice. Ken Page as Oogie Boogie, a villainous bogeyman in Halloween Town, who has a passion for gambling and betrays Jack. Ed Ivory as Santa Claus, the leader of Christmas Town. Santa Claus is responsible for the annual celebration of Christmas, when he delivers presents to children around the world. He is also referred to by Jack and all the other Halloween Town as "Sandy Claws". Ivory also voices the brief narration at the start of the film. Paul Reubens as Lock, one of the trick-or-treaters working for Oogie Boogie. Reubens and Burton had previously worked on Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985) and Batman Returns (1992). Frank Welker as Zero The cast also features Kerry Katz, Carmen Twillie, Randy Crenshaw, Debi Durst, Glenn Walters, Sherwood Ball, John Morris and Greg Proops voicing various characters. Patrick Stewart recorded narration for a prologue and epilogue. While not used in the final scene of the film, the narration is included on the soundtrack album.[12] Production[edit] Development[edit] As writer Burton's upbringing in Burbank, California, was associated with the feeling of solitude, the filmmaker was largely fascinated by holidays during his childhood. "Anytime there was Christmas or Halloween, […] it was great. It gave you some sort of texture all of a sudden that wasn't there before", Burton would later recall.[13] After completing his short film Vincent in 1982,[13] Burton, who was then employed at Walt Disney Feature Animation, wrote a three-page poem titled The Nightmare Before Christmas, drawing inspiration from television specials of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, How the Grinch Stole Christmas! and the poem A Visit from St. Nicholas.[14] Burton intended to adapt the poem into a television special with the narration spoken by his favorite actor, Vincent Price,[15] but also considered other options such as a children's book.[16] He created concept art and storyboards for the project in collaboration with Rick Heinrichs, who also sculpted character models;[17][18] Burton later showed his and Heinrichs' works-in-progress to Henry Selick, also a Disney animator at the time.[19] After the success of Vincent in 1982, Disney started to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30-minute holiday television special.[17] However, the project's development eventually stalled, as its tone seemed "too weird" to the company.[20] As Disney was unable to "offer his nocturnal loners enough scope", Burton was fired from the studio in 1984,[15] and went on to direct the commercially successful films Beetlejuice and Batman.[20] Director Henry Selick (left) and producer Tim Burton (right) on the Nightmare Before Christmas set Over the years, Burton regularly thought about the project. In 1990, Burton found out that Disney still owned the film rights.[21] He and Selick committed to produce a full-length film with the latter as director.[19] Burton's own success with live-action films piqued the interest of Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, who saw the film as an opportunity to continue the studio's streak of recent successes in feature animation.[22] Disney was looking forward to Nightmare "to show capabilities of technical and storytelling achievements that were present in Who Framed Roger Rabbit."[23] Walt Disney Pictures president David Hoberman believed the film would prove to be a creative achievement for Disney's image, elaborating "we can think outside the envelope. We can do different and unusual things."[22] Nightmare marked Burton's third consecutive film with a Christmas setting. Burton could not direct because of his commitment to Batman Returns, and he did not want to be involved with "the painstakingly slow process of stop motion".[19] To adapt his poem into a screenplay, Burton approached Michael McDowell, his collaborator on Beetlejuice. McDowell and Burton experienced creative differences, which convinced Burton to make the film as a musical with lyrics and compositions by frequent collaborator Danny Elfman. Elfman and Burton created a rough storyline and two-thirds of the film's songs.[7] Elfman found writing Nightmare's eleven songs as "one of the easiest jobs I've ever had. I had a lot in common with Jack Skellington."[17] Caroline Thompson had yet to be hired to write the screenplay.[7] With Thompson's screenplay, Selick stated, "there are very few lines of dialogue that are Caroline's. She became busy on other films and we were constantly rewriting, re-configuring and developing the film visually."[24] Filming[edit] Selick and his team of animators began production in July 1991 in San Francisco, California with a crew of over 120 workers, utilizing 20 sound stages for filming.[19][25] Joe Ranft was hired from Disney as a storyboard supervisor, while Eric Leighton was hired to supervise animation.[26] At the peak of production, 20 individual stages were simultaneously being used for filming.[27] In total, there were 109,440 frames taken for the film. The work of Ray Harryhausen, Ladislas Starevich, Edward Gorey, Étienne Delessert, Gahan Wilson, Charles Addams, Jan Lenica, Francis Bacon, and Wassily Kandinsky influenced the filmmakers. Selick described the production design as akin to a pop-up book.[17][24] In addition, Selick stated, "When we reach Halloween Town, it's entirely German Expressionism. When Jack enters Christmas Town, it's an outrageous Dr. Seuss-esque setpiece. Finally, when Jack is delivering presents in the 'Real World', everything is plain, simple and perfectly aligned."[28] Vincent Price, Don Ameche, and James Earl Jones were considered to provide the narration for the film's prologue; however, all proved difficult to cast, and the producers instead hired local voice artist Ed Ivory.[10] Patrick Stewart provided the prologue narration for the film's soundtrack. On the direction of the film, Selick reflected, "It's as though he [Burton] laid the egg, and I sat on it and hatched it. He wasn't involved in a hands-on way, but his hand is in it. It was my job to make it look like 'a Tim Burton film', which is not so different from my own films."[24] When asked about Burton's involvement, Selick claimed, "I don't want to take away from Tim, but he was not in San Francisco when we made it. He came up five times over two years, and spent no more than eight or ten days in total."[24] Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed with some second-layering traditional animation.[19] Burton found production somewhat difficult because he was simultaneously filming Batman Returns and pre-production of Ed Wood.[7] The filmmakers constructed 227 puppets to represent the characters in the movie, with Jack Skellington having "around four hundred heads", allowing the expression of every possible emotion.[29] Sally's mouth movements "were animated through the replacement method. During the animation process, […] only Sally's face 'mask' was removed in order to preserve the order of her long, red hair. Sally had ten types of faces, each made with a series of eleven expressions (e.g. eyes open and closed, and various facial poses) and synchronized mouth movements."[30] The stop-motion figurine of Jack was reused in James and the Giant Peach (also directed by Selick) as Captain Jack. Deleted scenes[edit] The Nightmare Before Christmas has deleted scenes that were cut, shortened, altered or removed of the final product due to different reasons during the making of the movie. Jack's scenes[edit] Many of Jack's scenes were altered, cut or shortened, including extended scenes of Jack's experiments, Jack seeing a gravestone with his name on in after the town presumed he was dead, and alternative scene where Oogie Boogie attacked Jack with his bugs. Oogie Boogie shadow dance[edit] The scene is part of the "The Oogie Boogie Man" song. In this short scene we watch Oogie Boogie's shadow dancing. The scene was animated but it was never used. Henry Selick said the scene was removed because of time purposes, despite the scene lasting only 17 seconds. The scene is part of the "The Oogie Boogie Man" song. Vampire hockey players[edit] This scene technically was in the movie, but it was changed. It was animated, too. In the original version of this scene, the vampires play ice hockey with Tim Burton's head. But the people who worked on the movie decided to replace Mr. Burton's severed head with a jack-o'-lantern. Alternative identity of Oogie Boogie[edit] This scene was never animated. The only thing left of this scene were the storyboards and the characters' voices. This scene starts just like in the end of the movie (1:07:19 to be percise), but instead of hundreds bugs living inside Oogie Boogie, inside the sack is Dr. Finkelstien. Jack asks him what is he doing and Dr. Finkelstien says that Sally loved Jack instead of him. So he, as Oogie Boogie, would teach her a lesson she would never forget. Then, Dr. Finkelstien says he will create someone that will love him and leaves with his assistant, Igor. Apparently, Tim Burton hated this plot twist so much he ordered it to be changed. Behemoth singing[edit] This scene was not animated. It is part of the "Making Christmas" song. The scene begins with Jack watching The One Under The Stairs sing as he wraps a voodoo doll. Then Behemoth appears and starts to sing. Finally, The One Under The Stairs and two other monsters start to sing with him. Oogie Boogie with dancing bugs[edit] This scene is part of the "The Oogie Boogie Man" song. It was not animated. The scene starts with Oogie Boogie singing. Next, five bugs come out of Oogie Boogie's eye and start to dance while Oogie Boogie sings. Then, Oogie Boogie blows making all five of the bugs go flying. As he does this, two other bugs come out of his mouth but they go with the other ones. Finally, Oogie Boogie starts to dance as he sings about eating Santa Claus. Henry Selick said the scene was removed due to its difficulty to animate.[citation needed] Soundtracks[edit] Main articles: The Nightmare Before Christmas (soundtrack) and Nightmare Revisited The film's soundtrack album was released in 1993 on Walt Disney Records. The film's soundtrack contains bonus tracks, including a longer prologue and an extra epilogue, both narrated by Sir Patrick Stewart. For the film's 2006 re-release in Disney Digital 3-D, a special edition of the soundtrack was released, featuring a bonus disc that contained covers of five of the film's songs by Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, Marilyn Manson, Fiona Apple, and She Wants Revenge. Four original demo tracks by Elfman were also included.[31] On September 30, 2008, Disney released the cover album Nightmare Revisited, featuring artists such as Amy Lee, Flyleaf, Korn, Rise Against, Plain White T's, The All-American Rejects, and many more.[32] American gothic rock band London After Midnight featured a cover of "Sally's Song" on their 1998 album Oddities. LiLi Roquelin performed a French cover of "Sally's Song" on her album Will you hate the rest of the world or will you renew your life? in 2010. Pentatonix released a cover of "Making Christmas" for their 2018 Christmas album Christmas Is Here!.[33] In 2003, the Disneyland Haunted Mansion Holiday soundtrack CD was released. Although most of the album's songs are not original ones from the film, one song is a medley of "Making Christmas", "What's This?", and "Kidnap the Sandy Claws". Other songs included are original holiday songs changed to incorporate the theme of the film. However, the last song is the soundtrack for the Disneyland Haunted Mansion Holiday ride. Release[edit] The Nightmare Before Christmas was originally going to be released by Walt Disney Pictures and be part of its animation lineup, but Disney decided to release the film under its adult film label Touchstone Pictures, because the studio thought the film would be "too dark and scary for kids," Selick remembered. "Their biggest fear, and why it was kind of a stepchild project, [was] they were afraid of their core audience hating the film and not coming."[34] To convey Burton's involvement and attract a wider audience, Disney marketed the film as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas.[22] Burton explained that,"…it turned more into more of a brand-name thing, it turned into something else, which I'm not quite sure about."[7] The film premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, 1993,[35] and was given a limited release on October 13, 1993, before its wide theatrical release on October 29, 1993. The Nightmare Before Christmas was reissued under the Walt Disney Pictures label and re-released on October 20, 2006, with conversion to Disney Digital 3-D.[4] Industrial Light & Magic assisted in the process.[26] The film subsequently received three re-releases in October 2007, 2008, and 2009.[36] The El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California has been showing the film in 4-D screenings annually in October, ending on Halloween, since 2010.[37] The reissues have led to a reemergence of 3-D films and advances in RealD Cinema.[38][39] In October 2020, The Nightmare Before Christmas was re-released in 2,194 theaters. It made $1.323 million over the weekend, finishing fourth behind Tenet.[40] Home media[edit] With years of successful home video sales, Nightmare later achieved the ranks of a cult film.[26] Touchstone Home Video first released the film on VHS on September 30, 1994, and on DVD on December 2, 1997. The DVD release contained no special features.[41] Nightmare was released a second time on October 3, 2000 as a special edition. The release included an audio commentary by Selick and cinematographer Pete Kozachik, a 28-minute making-of documentary, a gallery of concept art, storyboards, test footage and deleted scenes. Burton's Vincent and Frankenweenie were also included.[42] Both DVDs were non-anamorphic widescreen releases. Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on DVD again (this time with an anamorphic transfer) and on Blu-ray Disc (for the first time) on August 26, 2008 as a two-disc digitally remastered "collector's edition", but still containing the same special features.[43][44] Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released The Nightmare Before Christmas on Blu-ray 3D on August 30, 2011. The release included a Blu-ray 3D disc, Blu-ray disc and a DVD that includes both a DVD and digital copy of the film. In 2018, Disney issued a singalong version of the film, accompanied by the theatrical cut and a Movies Anywhere copy, as a single-disc version for the film's 25th anniversary.[45] Marketing[edit] Disney has extensively marketed the film and its characters across many forms of media and memorabilia, including action figures, books, games, art crafts, and fashion products. Jack Skellington, Sally, Pajama Jack, and the Mayor have been made into bendable figures,[46] while Jack and Sally even appear in fine art.[47] Sally has been made into an action figure and a Halloween costume.[48] Various Disneyland and the branching theme parks host attractions featuring Nightmare characters, particularly during Halloween and Christmas seasons. Since 2001, Disneyland has given its Haunted Mansion Holiday attraction a Nightmare Before Christmas theme for the holiday season. It features characters, decorations and music from the film. In addition to Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party and Mickey's Halloween Party featuring the film's characters,[49] Additionally, Jack hosts the Halloween Screams, HalloWishes, and Not So Spooky Spectacular! fireworks shows at Magic Kingdom (where the host is Ghost Host) and Disneyland (where the host is Jack himself), as well as the Frightfully Fun Parade.[50] Reception[edit] Box office[edit] Around the release of the film, Hoberman was quoted, "I hope Nightmare goes out and makes a fortune. If it does, great. If it doesn't, that doesn't negate the validity of the process. The budget was less than any Disney blockbuster so it doesn't have to earn Aladdin-sized grosses to satisfy us."[17] The film earned $50 million in the United States in its initial theatrical run[36] and was regarded as a moderate "sleeper hit". The Nightmare Before Christmas made an additional $11.1 million in box office gross in its 2006 reissue.[51] The 2007, 2008 and 2009 reissues earned $15.8 million and $2.5 million, respectively, increasing the film's total box office gross to $91.5 million.[36] Critical response[edit] The film initially received positive reviews from critics and it has since gone on to receive widespread critical acclaim, with critics and audiences praising the originality and creativity of the visual and storytelling elements, soundtrack, characters and innovative use of stop-motion animation (particularly most of the effects). On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 95%, based on 95 reviews, with an average rating of 8.27/10. The site's consensus reads, "The Nightmare Before Christmas is a stunningly original and visually delightful work of stop-motion animation."[52] On Metacritic the film has a score of 82 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[53] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A+ to F.[54] In IMDb the movie has a 8.0 out of a 10. Roger Ebert gave a highly positive review for Nightmare. Ebert believed the film's visual effects were as revolutionary as Star Wars, taking into account that Nightmare was "filled with imagination that carries us into a new world".[55] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called it a restoration of "originality and daring to the Halloween genre. This dazzling mix of fun and fright also explodes the notion that animation is kid stuff. … It's 74 minutes of timeless movie magic."[56] James Berardinelli stated "The Nightmare Before Christmas has something to offer just about everyone. For the kids, it's a fantasy celebrating two holidays. For the adults, it's an opportunity to experience some light entertainment while marveling at how adept Hollywood has become at these techniques. There are songs, laughs, and a little romance. In short, The Nightmare Before Christmas does what it intends to: entertain."[57] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post enjoyed the film's similarities to the writings of Oscar Wilde and the Brothers Grimm, as well as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and other German Expressionist films.[58] Michael A. Morrison discusses the influence of Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! on the film, writing that Jack parallels the Grinch and Zero parallels Max, the Grinch's dog.[59] Philip Nel writes that the film "challenges the wisdom of adults through its trickster characters", contrasting Jack as a "good trickster" with Oogie Boogie, whom he also compares with Seuss' Dr. Terwilliker as a bad trickster.[60] Entertainment Weekly reports that fan reception of these characters borders on obsession, profiling Laurie and Myk Rudnick, a couple whose "degree of obsession with [the] film is so great that … they named their son after the real-life person that a character in the film is based on."[61] This enthusiasm for the characters has also been profiled as having spread beyond North America to Japan.[62] Yvonne Tasker notes "the complex characterization seen in The Nightmare Before Christmas".[63] Danny Elfman was worried the characterization of Oogie Boogie would be considered racist by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).[64] Elfman's predictions came true; however, director Henry Selick stated the character was inspired by the Betty Boop cartoon The Old Man of the Mountain. "Cab Calloway would dance his inimitable jazz dance and sing 'Minnie the Moocher' or 'Old Man of the Mountain', and they would rotoscope him, trace him, turn him into a cartoon character, often transforming him into an animal, like a walrus," Selick continued. "I think those are some of the most inventive moments in cartoon history, in no way racist, even though he was sometimes a villain. We went with Ken Page, who is a black singer, and he had no problem with it".[24] Accolades[edit] The film was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. Nightmare won the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film, while Elfman won Best Music. Selick and the animators were also nominated for their work. Elfman was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score. Most recently, the film ranked #1 on Rotten Tomatoes' "Top 25 Best Christmas Movies" list.[65] Possible sequel[edit] In 2001, Disney began to consider producing a sequel, but rather than using stop motion, Disney wanted to use computer animation.[66] Burton convinced Disney to drop the idea. "I was always very protective of [The Nightmare Before Christmas], not to do sequels or things of that kind," Burton explained. "You know, Jack visits Thanksgiving world or other kinds of things just because I felt the movie had a purity to it and the people that like it, because it's a mass-market kind of thing, it was important to kind of keep that purity of it."[39] The 2004 video game The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge did serve as a sequel of the film, with Capcom's crew of developers going after Burton for advice[67] and having the collaboration of the film's art director, Deane Taylor.[68] In 2009, Selick said he would do a film sequel if he and Burton could create a good story for it.[69] In February 2019, it was reported that a new Nightmare Before Christmas film was in the works with Disney considering either a stop-motion sequel or live-action remake.[70] In October 2019, Chris Sarandon expressed interest on reprising his role as Jack Skellington if a sequel film ever materializes.[71] On February 22, 2021, it was announced by Disney Publishing that a sequel was being given to the 1993 film in the form of a young adult novel. It will be written by Shea Ernshaw and features Sally as the main character and be told through her point-of-view, with events taking place after the film.[72] Related media[edit] Toys and games[edit] A collectible card game based on the film called The Nightmare Before Christmas TCG was released in 2005 by NECA. The game was designed by Quixotic Games founder Andrew Parks[73] and Zev Shlasinger. It consists of a Premiere set and 4 Starter Decks based on four characters, Jack Skellington, the Mayor, Oogie Boogie, and Doctor Finklestein. Each Starter Deck contains a rule book, a Pumpkin King card, a Pumpkin Points card, and a 48-card deck. The game has four card types: Characters, Locales, Creations, and Surprises. The Cards' rarities are separated into four categories: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Ultra Rare.
