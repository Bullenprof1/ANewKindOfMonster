He became involved in amateur film making in his teen years, but majored in education when he attended Tokyo Gakugei University.[1] After graduation, he found a job at the major Japanese movie studio Nikkatsu.[1] By 1982 he was a screenwriter and assistant director for Nikkatsu's line of Roman porno films.[2][3] He made his debut as a director with Nikkatsu in February 1984 with Kōichirō Uno's Wet and Swinging, part of a long-running Nikkatsu series based on the works of erotic novelist Kōichirō Uno.[3][4] That work along with two other Roman porno films he directed for Nikkatsu that year, OL Yurizoku 19-sai (ＯＬ百合族・19才) and Eve-chan-no hime (イヴちゃんの姫), won him the Best New Director award at the 6th Yokohama Film Festival.[4][5] The next year, his manga-based April 1985 movie for Nikkatsu, Minna Agechau, took the award as the 9th Best Film of the year at the 7th Yokohama Film Festival.[6] In July 1986, still at Nikkatsu, he directed Mischievous Lolita: Attacking the Virgin From Behind (いたずらロリータ　後からバージン, Itazura Lolita: Ushirokara virgin), which despite its strange title, was a fantasy about a sex-doll coming to life as a woman.[7][8] Kaneko's final film for Nikkatsu was the appropriately named Last Cabaret, the second to last of the studio's Roman porno series. The film, released in April 1988, about a cabaret forced to close has been taken as a metaphor for the demise of the studio itself.[9][10] The year 1988 marked a watershed in Kaneko's career as a director. At the 10th Yokohama Film Festival, he was given the Best Director award for his two films of 1988, the Roman porno Last Cabaret for Nikkatsu and Summer Vacation 1999, a mainstream film for the Shochiku studio.[11] Nikkatsu ceased their Roman porno film line that year and filed for bankruptcy a few years later[12] and Kaneko moved full-time into mainstream film.
