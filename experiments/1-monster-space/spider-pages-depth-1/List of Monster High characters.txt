They remarked that because the characters are monsters, they had more freedom to do things that ordinary kids could not do.[3] Other inspirations include children's interests in Tim Burton and Lady Gaga.[4] Kiyomi Haverly, Mattel's design vice president, said "Honestly, it was very surprising to us. We just noticed girls were into darker goth fashion." The dolls were created by Garrett Sander and illustrated by Kellee Riley.[4][5] Other doll designers include Rebecca Shipman and Natalie Villegas.[6][7] Main characters[edit] This section may be written from a fan's point of view, rather than a neutral point of view.

(July 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Six of the Monster High characters have been classified as Original Ghouls by the official website.[8] Frankie Stein[edit] Frankie Stein (voiced by Kate Higgins in 2010–15,[a] Cassandra Morris in 2016–present[9][10]) is the daughter of Frankenstein's monster and his bride and the granddaughter of Victor Frankenstein's (since Victor had built her parents). Frankie is the sweetest and kindest girl at Monster High, believing strongly that everyone's flaws make them unique. Starting at 15 days old, she is also the youngest student at Monster High. Apart from being kind and generous, she is very optimistic and never gives up in the face of adversity. However, since all of her prior knowledge about teen relationships came from magazines, she can be a bit naive and inexperienced in teenage issues. Being a Frankenstein's monster herself, Frankie is portrayed as having light green skin and her body being stitched together. Because of this, her arms and legs can be detached from her body and still move, which she has used several times to help her friends. However, sometimes her limbs can still fly off suddenly when she is tense, scared or angry. To function, she is powered by electricity and has to be recharged every night. Her electricity is concentrated in two bolts at her neck that she often uses for self-defence or to power electronics in a pinch, although she sometimes accidentally shocks people. One of the most distinguishing characteristics of Frankie is that she has heterochromia--- her right eye is blue whilst her left eye is green. She also has white hair streaked with black and her fringe is pulled back and clipped. On school days she typically wears a seifuku coupled with a tie, gingham pattern and monochrome platforms. Her love interest is Neighthan Rot. Clawdeen Wolf[edit] Clawdeen Wolf (voiced by Salli Saffioti)[11] is the daughter of the Werewolf. She is 15 years old and has a large family; two of her siblings Clawd and Howleen are currently studying in Monster High with her, and her older sister Clawdia has graduated and is a working adult. She has the best fashion sense in school, and aspires to be a star fashion designer.[12] Being Draculaura's best friend, she is very protective of her, as well as Clawd and Howleen despite often bickering with them. Clawdeen is portrayed as a brown-skinned werewolf with chocolate brown curly hair and pierced ears. On school days, she wears a leopard-print top, a leather jacket and a purple miniskirt paired with matching stockings and grey platform boots. Clawdeen's greatest strengths are her physical capabilities of being a werewolf --- she possesses immense strength and speed, especially during the full moon, but this also makes her prone to bad moods and a fiery temper. She has a purple pet kitten named Crescent.[13] Cleo de Nile[edit] Cleo de Nile (voiced by Salli Saffioti)[11] is the daughter of the Egyptian mummy named Ramses de Nile. Cleo is the most popular ghoul in school. Apart from being popular, she is also the student council president of Monster High, and captain of the Fearleading Squad. Being a Mummy and preserved for many years, her appearance is that of a 16-year-old girl but is actually over 3,000 years old. While her profile lists her as 3,357 years old,[14] previous iterations as well as the videos had shown her true age to be 5,842 years old.[15] Her boyfriend is Deuce Gorgon.[14] Cleo is portrayed as a beautiful auburn-skinned girl with rich black hair and gold highlights. Her top and bottoms are the residue of her Egyptian Mummy bandages, which she adds style to with glittery blue stripes and bandage ribbons. Her platforms are also worn with bandages. Cleo's most distinguishing characteristic is her blue rhinestone tiara and large gold earrings, a sure sign of her royal heritage. Cleo's personality is a little spoiled, and much of a diva, priding herself greatly on her popularity, fashion sense, as well as the many amulets her family pyramid houses. However, she is secretly very caring and sweet to her friends. Cleo's catchphrase is: "Oh my RA!" Draculaura[edit] Draculaura (voiced by Debi Derryberry)[16] is the daughter of Count Dracula and is 1,600 years old. She is described as bright, optimistic and ambitious.[17] Despite being a vampire, she is a vegan who consumes fruits, vegetables and "a lot of iron supplements" instead of blood.[17] Mattel vice-president of design Kiyomi Haverly said "She's a vegan. She's turned off by meat. Girls could really relate to that because that's part of what they're thinking of these days."[18] She is initially 1,599 years old and turns 1,600 in the webisode "Party Planners" and the film Why Do Ghouls Fall In Love, with Mattel releasing a doll line based around her birthday. Her original name was Ula D. as filed in the trademark by Mattel back in 2007.[19][20] Draculaura currently dates Clawd, Clawdeen's older brother, and has a pet bat named Count Fabulous. As can be seen from her clothes and closet, her favourite colour is pink. Draculaura is one of the most popular ghouls at school, due to her friendliness. In Frights, Camera, Action, Draculaura ends up getting her vampire powers unlocked. Due to her being a vegan, she faints at the sight or mention of blood. Draculaura is portrayed as a pink-skinned vampire with black hair and pink streaks running through it. On school days, she secures her hair into pigtails and wears a pink zipper top with a ruffled white collar and fishnet fabric sleeves, paired with a white miniskirt and girly pink boots. Due to her birthday being on Valentine's Day Draculaura has a pink heart tattoo at the corner of her left eye. From her hobby of dressing Count Fabulous up in girly clothes and her fashion sense, Draculaura is a girly girl who loves the colour pink. Draculaura's best character trait is her friendliness, which can be seen from her wide social circle. She likes to talk a lot, adores romantic sentiments and her favourite class is creative-writing. As revealed in the 2016 franchise reboot, Welcome to Monster High, Draculaura originally lived with her father on a mansion on a hill overlooking Normie Town. Wanting to have friends like her, she talked her father into opening Monster High. Ghoulia Yelps[edit] Ghoulia Yelps (vocal effects provided by Audu Paden) is the bespectacled daughter of a zombie couple and Cleo's personal assistant and best friend. She has a pet baby blue owl named Sir Hoots-a-Lot. The smartest ghoul at Monster High, Ghoulia is a shy and bookish girl, but Cleo de Nile refuses to let her be the wallflower at a party. She can only speak in the zombie language (moans and groans) due to physical limitations that all zombies have. Ghoulia's social life has improved greatly since befriending Cleo. She is the shortest girl at Monster High. Part of this may be because as a zombie, she never stands up straight. Ghoulia has a romantic interest in Slo-Moe, a tall male zombie on the chess team. Ghoulia is well known to be a hardcore fan of "Dead Fast", an in-universe comic book series. She also has a love for the game of dodgeball. Her favorite color is red. Although introduced as one of the six Original Ghouls,[21] she was no longer listed among them following the 2016 reboot of Welcome to Monster High.[22][23][24] Lagoona Blue[edit] Lagoona Blue (voiced by Laura Bailey in 2010–2015, Larissa Gallagher in 2016–Present) is the daughter of the Gill-man Wade Blue and a sea nymph, who is all fish. She is a kind and loving girl, with a tomboyish style to her clothes, and has problems with Gil's parents due to her sea-monster heritage. However, they started to like her only for being a freshwater monster when she turned into one from Howleen's wish in "13 Wishes". Lagoona is a kind and friendly ghoul who loves swimming.

Please clean it up to conform to a higher standard of quality, and to make it neutral in tone. (July 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The following male characters in Monster High are referred to as Mansters: Clawd Wolf[edit] Clawd Wolf (voiced by Ogie Banks,[26]) is the son of a werewolf who is also the seventeen-year-old brother of Clawdeen, Howleen, and Clawdia. According to "Bat Dialing Disaster", he has already had his birthday, which must officially make him eighteen years old. He is the oldest child still living in his parents' house. He dated Cleo prior to Frankie attending Monster High in the dolls' diaries when he was struck by one of C.A. Cupid's arrows. Eventually, the magic wore off and he broke up with Cleo who began dating Deuce the next day. Clawd is the Big Monster on Campus and plays on the casketball team with Deuce. He owns a pet gargoyle bulldog named Rockseena. He is also overprotective of his sisters Clawdeen and Howleen according to "Fright On!". Despite being long-time friends since younger youth, he finally falls for Draculaura in Volume 2, and she did the same thing for him, but first. Clawd has dark brown fur and bright yellow eyes. Deuce Gorgon[edit] Deuce Gorgon (voiced by Yuri Lowenthal in Volumes 1 and 2, Cam Clarke in Volume 3, Evan Smith for the rest of Volume 3, Volume 4, and 5) is the son of the gorgon Medusa. Like his mother, he has snakes for hair, which he styles in a "snake-hawk". He is 16 years old and hopes to get his driver's license soon. He is a member of the casketball team. He also loves to cook and is quite a skilled chef, but he is too self-conscious to showcase his culinary ability to anyone. Deuce inherited his mother's ability to turn people into stone, though he has been able to control the effect so that it lasts for only about twenty-four hours. His petrifying stare does not work on gargoyles which he learns by bumping into Rochelle Goyle. He takes off his sunglasses only when he talks to her. In "Hiss-teria", he reveals that he accidentally petrified his first pet (a dragon named Smokey) when he was a young boy and the effect has lingered to the present day. Deuce is dating Cleo, who seems to always find new ways for him to spend all his money on her. Despite that, Deuce genuinely loves Cleo and wrote a song to express his feelings for her. His pet is a two-tailed rat which he named Perseus after Perseus who Medusa clashed with in her past. Understandably, Medusa is not amused. His favorite color is neon green, which neon green is the color of his hair and Neon Green eyes. His favorite food is "Greek Fusion" (his own creation). Deuce's first name is clearly, obviously named after part of Medusa's name by Sander, the "dus" part, such as "Meh-DEUCE-uh". Finnegan Wake[edit] Finnegan Wake is a merman who is the son of a mermaid. He is shown to be wheelchair bound on land which leads the ghouls to underestimate his abilities. Finnegan is shown to be a daredevil and thrill seeker who doesn't let his disability get in the way of what he wants to do. He was originally referred to as Rider in the webisode, which may be a nickname. He was originally called "Ryder" or "Rider". Garrott DuRoque[edit] Garrott DuRoque (voiced by Evan Smith) is a French gargoyle from Scaris, France and son of a Gargoyle who is Rochelle Goyle's boyfriend. He now comes in a doll two-pack with Rochelle. His flowers are his "pets" and he is a perfectionist. Gillington "Gil" Webber[edit] Gillington "Gil" Webber (voiced by Yuri Lowenthal in Volumes One and Two, Evan Smith in later seasons, the CGI specials and Fright On!) is the son of two freshwater-river monsters and is Lagoona Blue's boyfriend. He was first introduced in the webisode "Blue Lagoona" and has made recurring appearances since. Gil is one of the top members on the swim team alongside Lagoona. When on land, Gil has to wear a water-filled helmet over his head in order to breathe, though "Hatch Me if You Can" and the Gloom Beach arc shows that he can be on land for a short period of time without it. Gil is from freshwater, which is why it is hard for him and Lagoona (who can survive in saltwater) to be together. Heath Burns[edit] Heath Burns (voiced by Yuri Lowenthal in Volume 1, Cam Clarke in the other volumes) is the teenage son of two Fire Elementals. In the Polish version of Monster High webisodes, his name is Ross Burla and in the French EU he is named Thomas Cramé. Heath was first seen as a background character in "Substitute Creature". In "The Hot Boy", he was shown to be Draculaura's short-lived crush. In "Fear Pressure", he mentions that Jackson is his human cousin, a possible reference to when many fans confused Heath Burns for Holt Hyde. Heath's first mention in the dolls' continuity is in Abbey's diary where he is constantly hitting on her with corny one-liners. Heath primarily serves as the comedy relief, being the butt of many physical jokes and the class clown. He and Abbey are now dating. He thinks she's "hot" and she likes that he "makes her laugh". He often calls Abbey "baby" which she corrects him over constantly, telling him her name is Abbey not Baby. In the first novel, Heath appears to be a normie (human). In Book 2, "The Ghoul Next Door", this Heath is revealed to be a RAD (monster) when he sneezes fire. He explains that his ability appeared when he turned fifteen. Starting out as gassy outbursts, Heath's ability is still dangerous. Heath has yellow skin, red eyes and orange hair that bursts into flame when he's excited. He's shown as being close friends with Manny Taur, the two are often seen hanging out together. Invisi Billy[edit] Invisi Billy (voiced by Evan Smith) is the son of the Invisible Man. Invisi Billy can be seen as a bit of a prankster, but he can be kind and sweet, as in helping Rochelle Goyle with her dance in "Fright Dance". He loves drama, particularly special effects which are his forte. His girlfriend is Scarah Screams (who is also his BFF) as they got together in the webisode "Scarah-Voyant" thanks to Frankie. Catty Noir is also Invisi Billy's BFF. Invisi Billy first appeared as an April Fool's joke on Facebook, picturing an empty box with the blurb "How do you know I'm not in the box?" Since then, his character and design have been refined and changed. His doll has very pale blue/grey skin that fades to transparent blue are his feet. He has dark blue hair and grey eyes. His ears are both gauged, making him the first Monster High boy to have both ears pierced. Jackson Jekyll / Holt Hyde[edit] Jackson Jekyll (voiced by Cindy Robinson) is a normie boy at Monster High, and enjoys sports (particularly casketball) and video games. Jackson is the son of "Dr. Jekyll", though it's unclear if this is his father, though in the books, Dr. Jekyll is his mother, Sydney Jekyll. His diary implies the original Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde were his grandfather and his mother seems to possess the ability to shift. In the web series, Jackson is related to Heath Burns (they are cousins) but through which parent hasn't been clearly explained. Jackson is depicted as a major nerd in the webisodes and specials, though he seems to possess a wicked sense of humour ("Oh I fit in... my locker, trash cans... you'd be surprised what those guys fit me into"). He is first mentioned in Draculaura's diary where he unsettles her father by telling him he needs to "drive a stake into something". Jackson has black hair with blond or yellow streaks. His eyes are blue. He wears glasses, has one eyebrow pierced and has a Yin Yang symbol tattooed between his shoulder-blades. Holt Hyde (also voiced by Cindy Robinson) is the alter-ego version of Jackson Jekyll and the son of Mr. and Mrs. Hyde, who Jackson turns into when loud music plays (when he sweats in the Lisi Harrison novels). Originally in the diaries, it was the sun setting that triggered Jackson's transformation into his alter ego. His diary explains that the trigger is likely to change several times as he ages before finally settling. Holt on the other hand seems to be more fire elemental than normie. His skin is bright blue, his eyes are red and he has fiery-colored hair. He's depicted in the webisodes and specials as rather excitable and loud. He loves to DJ and is friends with Operetta. They tried to date once, but Holt's hot temper spoiled things. In the prom website event called "A Night in Scare-adise" on Monsterhigh.com he and Operetta attended prom together. Operetta was quoted as saying he "rocks my l'il ol' face off." Holt is often shown as a DJ at school dance events. He annotated Jackson's diary with sarcastic remarks. Like Jackson, Holt has a Yin Yang tattoo on his back and a pierced eyebrow. (His Swim Class doll is missing this detail however). In the books, his name is DJ Hyde. Jackson and Holt share a pet Chameleon named Crossfade. Neighthan Rot[edit] Neighthan Rot (voiced by Josey Montana McCoy) is one of the new "hybrid" students of Monster High. He is the son of a zombie (father) and a unicorn (mother). He has long black hair with blue, yellow, and red highlights in a ponytail, and he wears a colorful shirt and pants whose color splash patterns seem remincient of anatomical models. Neighthan is somewhat clumsy, but he is a social monster who loves hanging out with his beast friends. He doesn't like monsters judging other monsters based on their appearances. He has the ability to heal thanks to his unicorn horn. He makes his first webisode appearance in "Graveyard Grates". He looks a little less like a unicorn because he only has a tail, a horn, and rainbow hair. From his zombie side, he has grey zombie-skin, and a marking on the left side of his face around his eye. Neighthan has human legs and feet instead of horse-like legs and hooves. He has a blue unicorn-horn, and wears a ponytail with a strand of hair coming down the left side of his face. He also wears a T-shirt with a rib cage on it and difficult multi-colors. He has romantic feelings for Frankie Stein, which seems to be mutual. Neightan was designed by Garrett Sander.[6] Porter Geiss[edit] Porter Geiss (nicknamed Paintergeist) (voiced by Todd Haberkorn) is a character in Monster High who debuts in the TV special "Haunted". He is the son of the Poltergeist and is an expert artist where he often gets in trouble with Haunted High's Hall Moanitors. Porter falls in love with Spectra Vondergeist in "Haunted," but decides to continue attending Haunted High instead. Sloman "Slo-Mo" Mortovitch[edit] Sloman "Slo-Mo" Mortovitch (vocal effects provided by Audu Paden) is a zombie who was originally addressed as Moe "Slow Moe" Deadovitch instead throughout the series, before any dolls were released and before it was officially addressed on Monster High's website in the description of "Flowers for Slo Moe". He is Ghoulia's official boyfriend. Other characters[edit] Main characters from book series[edit] The following characters are exclusive to the book adaptions of this franchise: Melody Carver[edit] Melody Carver is the co-protagonist of the Monster High novels by Lisi Harrison. She and her family are from Beverly Hills and moved to Salem, Oregon to help with Melody's asthma.[218] Melody has just recovered from rhinoplasty that was meant to help her with her breathing, but is implied to have been mostly to please her parents' family image. Melody's family is neighbors with Jackson Jekyll, whom Melody eventually dates. Melody is the one who reveals the truth behind Jackson's blackouts through a recording on her iPhone. Unfortunately, she forgets to delete it and it gets in the hands of Bekka Madden, a RAD hater and primary antagonist of the series. This video leads to the RADs community becoming exposed, Melody forming the NUDIs (Normies Uncool with Discriminating Idiots), and a documentary on their secret lives. At the end of the second novel, Melody learns from Manu, Cleo's father's aide, that she might be the daughter of Marina, a siren. This is confirmed at the end of the third novel. Melody develops the ability to persuade people to do whatever she asks with her voice. She also grows olive and blue feathers with gold tips. This inspires her to make a dress and jewelry out of them.
