She was married to the King Lelex of Laconia. Cleocharia was the ancestress of the Spartan royal family and gave birth to two children: Myles and Polycaon. Her son, Myles, had a son named Eurotas (presumably named after his great-grandfather). Eurotas had a daughter named Sparta, who married Lacedaemon.[2] Lacedaemon named the city of Sparta after his wife. However, the city's name would also be his own, as it was called either Lacedaemon or Sparta interchangeably. Note[edit] ^ Bolles, William, ed. (1845).
