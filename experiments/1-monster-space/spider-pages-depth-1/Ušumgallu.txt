Usually described as a lion-dragon demon,[1] it has been somewhat speculatively identified with the four-legged, winged dragon of the late 3rd millennium BCE. Mythology[edit] Tiamat is said to have "clothed the raging lion-dragons with fearsomeness" in the Epic of Creation, Enuma Elish. The god Nabû was described as "he who tramples the lion-dragon" in the hymn to Nabû.[6] The late neo-Assyrian text "Myth of the Seven Sages" recalls: "The fourth (of the seven apkallu's, "sages", is) Lu-Nanna, (only) two-thirds Apkallu, who drove the ušumgallu-dragon from É-ninkarnunna, the temple of Ištar of Šulgi."[7] Aššur-nāṣir-apli II placed golden icons of ušumgallu at the pedestal of Ninurta.[8] Its name became a royal and divine epithet, for example: ušumgal kališ parakkī, "unrivaled ruler of all the sanctuaries".[9] Marduk is called "the ušumgallu-dragon of the great heavens".
