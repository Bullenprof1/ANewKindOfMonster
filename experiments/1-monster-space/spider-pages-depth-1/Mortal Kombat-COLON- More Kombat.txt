Babylon Zoo's "Spaceman" had already been released as a single in 1995. Alien Factory's "Higher" later turned up in the second movie, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, and Juno Reactor's "The Journey Kontinues" was later released under the title "Biot Messiah" on the single "God Is God" (1997). Two of the tracks appeared in the animated series Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm: Psykosonik's "It Has Begun" and Sister Machine Gun's "Deeper Down". Track 16 is exclusive to the cassette release[3] and was taken from the EBN's album Telecommunication Breakdown.
