Mythology[edit] The most prolonged account of her is given in John Tzetzes' scholia on Lycophron, and runs as follows. The tree in which Chrysopeleia dwelt was put in danger by the waters of a flooding river. She was rescued by Arcas, who happened to be hunting in the neighborhood: he rerouted the river and secured the tree with a dam. Chrysopeleia became his lover and bore him two sons, Apheidas and Elatus.[1] Chrysopeleia is also mentioned in the Bibliotheca as one of the possible spouses of Arcas.[2] Notes[edit] ^ Tzetzes on Lycophron, Alexandra 480 (with a reference to Eumelus of Corinth) ^ Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3.9.1 Reference[edit] Pseudo-Apollodorus, The Library with an English Translation by Sir James George Frazer, F.B.A., F.R.S. in 2 Volumes, Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1921.
