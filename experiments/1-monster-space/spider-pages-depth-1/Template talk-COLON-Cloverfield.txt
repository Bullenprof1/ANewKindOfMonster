Is this really necessary? I mean, honestly. --Squirminator2k (talk) 01:20, 21 July 2008 (UTC) I'm usually against the overzealous ceation of these linkboxes, and this one is no exception. Still, it does at least remain on topic and has no rediculous links. So from what I know, you won't find much concensus to delete it. -Verdatum (talk) 14:21, 21 July 2008 (UTC)
