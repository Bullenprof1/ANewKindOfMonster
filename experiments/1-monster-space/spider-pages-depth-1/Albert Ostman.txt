Albert Ostman (circa 1893 – 1975)[1] was a Canadian prospector who reported that he was abducted by a Sasquatch and held captive for six days.[2] He stated that the event took place near Toba Inlet, British Columbia in 1924. The story[edit] In 1924, Albert Ostman, a lumberjack and woodsman, went to the area for a vacation. Ostman had heard stories about the "man beasts" who supposedly roamed these woods but refused to believe them.[3] As Ostman lay asleep one evening a Sasquatch purportedly picked him up and carried him off while he was in his sleeping bag.[4] Ostman was carried in his sleeping bag across country for 3 hours by the Sasquatch.[5] The Sasquatch dropped Ostman down on a plateau. Standing around him was a family of 4 of the creatures.[6] Albert was kept captive by the Sasquatch. The captors were 2 adults and 2 children which held Ostman captive for six days.[7] One of the Bigfoots was reported as being 8 feet tall.[8] Ostman did not use his gun on them as they had done him no harm.[9] He stayed with the Bigfoot family for a week.[10] Ostman ate "sweet tasting grass" that they gave him.[11] According to Ostman the female Sasquatch washed and stacked leaves.[12] Albert escaped by making the large male Sasquatch groggy by feeding him some snuff.[13] He did not tell his story for more than 24 years after it happened for fear of being thought of as crazy.[14] As more Sasquatch stories appeared in the press Albert decided to tell his story to a local newspaper, The Province, in 1957.[15] In 2007, the skeptic Joe Nickell characterized the story as "more likely the result of imagination than of recollection".[16] Critics of Ostman note that he did not make the event public until 1957, thirty three years after he said it took place.[17] Primatologist John Napier states that "Ostman's story fails to convince me primarily on the grounds of the limited food resources available."[18] Bigfoot researcher Peter Byrne cannot accept Ostman's story without more evidence.[19] See also[edit] Bigfoot References[edit] ^ Guittilla, Peter (2003).
