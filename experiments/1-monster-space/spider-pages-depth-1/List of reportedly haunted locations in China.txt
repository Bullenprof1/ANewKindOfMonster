They built two identical mansions and lived in a lavish lifestyle, with a garden around their mansions complete with peacocks, tigers, and crocodiles. During the prime of their life they both mysteriously disappeared. One of the mansions was razed in the 1950s, and to make way for the Shanghai's growing high-rises, the last mansion was to be moved to a new location in 2009. From that point on believing workers have claimed of bizarre animal bites and sightings.[1][22] The Wukang Mansion, formerly known as the Normandie Apartment, in Shanghai, was named after the World War I battleship Normandie, and was designed by the famous Hungarian architect Ladislav Hudec. During the Cultural Revolution of 1966–76, the Red Guards renamed the building Anti-Revisionist Tower, but local residents referred to it as "The Diving Board" because of the dozens of suicides by intellectuals and others who were persecuted as "state enemies". For this reason, believers claim it is haunted by the ghosts of persecuted individuals.[1][23][24] See also[edit] Ghosts in Chinese culture List of reportedly haunted locations List of supernatural beings in Chinese folklore References[edit] ^ a b c d e Cultural, China (2015-01-02).
