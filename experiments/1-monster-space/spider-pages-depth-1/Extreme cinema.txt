Extreme cinema is a genre of film distinguished by its use of excessive violence, torture, and sex of extreme nature. The rising popularity of Asian films in the 21st century has contributed to the growth of extreme cinema, although extreme cinema is still considered to be a cult-based genre. Being a relatively new genre, extreme cinema is controversial and widely unaccepted by the mainstream media.[1] Extreme cinema films target a specific and small audience group.[2] Contents 1 History 2 Controversy 2.1 Classification and guidelines 3 Notable films 4 Notable directors 5 See also 6 References 7 Sources 8 External links History[edit] The prehistory of extreme cinema can be traced back to censorship of art films and advertising tactics for classical exploitation films to Anglophone markets alongside later liberal representations of sex in the first half of the 20th Century onwards.[3] The name "extreme cinema" originated from a “line of Asian films that share a combination of sensational features, such as extreme violence, horror and shocking plots”.[4] Controversy[edit] Extreme cinema is highly criticized and debated by film critics and the general public. There have been debates over the hypersexualization that makes these films a threat to the ‘mainstream’ community standards.[5] There has also been criticism over the increasing use of violence in modern-day films. Ever since the emergence of slasher-gore films in the ’70s, the rising popularity of extreme cinema has contributed to the casual violence in popular media.[6] Some criticize the easy exposure and unintended targeting of adolescence by extreme cinema films.[7] Classification and guidelines[edit] The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) classifies extreme cinema films into an "R18" rating, which is defined as “special and legally restricted classification primarily for explicit works of consenting sex or strong fetish material involving adults.”[5] Notable films[edit] A Serbian Film[8][9][10] (2010) Audition[11] (1999) Bad Taste[12] (1987) Begotten[12] (1990) Benny's Video [12] (1992) Blood Feast[12] (1963) Braindead (Dead Alive)[12] (1992) Caligula, unrated version[12] (1979) Cannibal Holocaust[13][14] (1980) Crash[12] (1996) The Devils[12] (1971) Dogtooth[11] (2009) Faces of Death[12] (1979) Funny Games[11][15] (1997) Hellraiser[16] (1987) The Hills Have Eyes[17] (1977) Hostel[18] (2005) The Human Centipede[19] (2009) I Spit on Your Grave[20] (1978) In the Realm of the Senses[21] (1976) Irréversible[11][22] (2002) I Stand Alone[23] (1998) Last House on the Left[24] (1972) Man Bites Dog[25] (1992) Martyrs[8][26] (2008) Oldboy[27] (2003) Melancholie der Engel (2009) Mysterious Skin[28] (2004) Pink Flamingos[29] (1972) The Poughkeepsie Tapes[30] (2007) Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead[31] (2006) Rambo 4[32] (2008) Re-Animator[33] (1985) Requiem for a Dream[34] (2000) Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom[14] (1975) Saw (2004) [35] Sick: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist[36] (1997) Sweet Movie[37] (1974) Taxidermia[38] (2006) Thriller: A Cruel Picture[39] (1973) Un Chien Andalou[40] (1929) Notable directors[edit] Early Peter Jackson (aforementioned Bad Taste and Dead Alive)[12] Early Wes Craven (aforementioned Last House on the Left and original Hill Have Eyes)[41][42] Uwe Boll[12] Bruno Dumont[43] Lars von Trier[44] Takashi Miike[45] Gaspar Noé [46] Pier Paolo Pasolini (aforementioned Salo)[14] Sion Sono[47] See also[edit] Exploitation film Dogme 95 Vulgar auteurism Giallo New French Extremity Social thriller References[edit] ^ Dirks, Tim. “100 Most Controversial Films of All Time.” 100 Most Controversial Films of All Time.
