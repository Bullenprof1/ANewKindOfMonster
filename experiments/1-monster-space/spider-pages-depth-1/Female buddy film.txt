The main cast is often female, depending on the plot. Background[edit] The female buddy film is a recent trend in mainstream cinema. Thelma & Louise with its darker themes, remains one of the most notable female buddy films to date and had a similar popular impact as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in the early 1990s. Similar films also paved the way for onscreen female friendships such as that between Evelyn Couch and Ninny Threadgoode in Fried Green Tomatoes. Other popular duos include those in Waiting to Exhale and Walking and Talking.[1] Examples[edit] Jonathan Rosenbaum has praised Jacques Rivette's 1974 film Céline and Julie Go Boating as an example of the genre and wrote that he knows "many women who consider Céline et Julie vont en bateau their favorite movie about female friendship."[2] Dennis Lim sees the influence of Rivette's film in other female buddy films, such as Susan Seidelman's Desperately Seeking Susan and David Lynch's Mullholland Drive.[3] It was also influential on and referenced in Erick Zonca's 1998 film The Dreamlife of Angels.[4] The genre is crossed with the buddy cop film in the 2013 comedy The Heat, in which a brash police officer (Melissa McCarthy) is teamed with a straightlaced FBI agent (Sandra Bullock).[5] Other later examples include Booksmart (2019)[6] and the animated TV series Tuca & Bertie.[7] See also[edit] Womance Feminist cinema Bromance Notes[edit] ^ 10 Great Female Buddy Comedies - Flavorwire ^ Rosenbaum, Jonathan (June 28, 1983).
