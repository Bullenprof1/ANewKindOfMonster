Contents 1 Reviews 2 Track listing 3 Personnel 4 Expanded Edition 5 References Reviews[edit] Steven McDonald of Allmusic thought it was "A dark and stormy score that fits the cold atmosphere of the film perfectly", awarding 4 out of 5 stars.[5] Matt Peterson of Track Sounds, however, was negative stating, "it is quite disarrayed and incoherent. The lack of any solid thematic material hurts the viability of this music for the film, and destroys its listening potential on CD."[6] John Fallon of JoBlo.com felt it was "An adequate score that supports its whacked out scenes properly."[7] Track listing[edit] All music is composed by John Frizzell, except as noted.
