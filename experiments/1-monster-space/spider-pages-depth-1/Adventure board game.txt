The origins of these two types of game are related. In the early 1970s, Dave Arneson introduced his role-playing game, Blackmoor, to a group of players. One of those players, Gary Gygax, collaborated with Arneson to create Dungeons & Dragons (1974). Another member of that gaming group, Dave Megarry, translated the experience into the board game, Dungeon! (1975), the first adventure board game.[1] In fact, the term "adventure gaming" in the 1970s referred to what later became known as tabletop role-playing games, and only later became associated with board games.[2]:306 1980s[edit] The genre saw a particular boom in the 1980s, when its key subgenres had been codified by three major releases of the decade:[2]:306 Competitive fantasy adventure games, codified by Dungeon! and particularly Games Workshop's Talisman (1983), Cooperative investigative adventure games, pioneered by Chaosium's Arkham Horror (1987), and Cooperative fantasy adventure games, a combination of the other two directions, first produced in GW and Milton Bradley Company's HeroQuest (1989). 1990s[edit] In the 1990s, both adventure board games and tabletop RPGs saw a sharp decline in popularity in the wake of the collectible card game boom and bust.[2]:307 2000s[edit] Fantasy Flight Games has brought all three subgenres back into the market with their Runebound (2004), the second edition of Arkham Horror (2005), and Descent: Journeys in the Dark (2006), respectively. Other companies published their own takes on the genre, such as Atlas Games' card-based Dungeoneer (2003) and Pegasus Spiele's Return of the Heroes (2003), which was one of the earliest examples of the genre to employ eurogame mechanics — something Fantasy Flight Games also embraced in their own later games.[2]:307 2010s[edit] In the 2010s, the adventure board game genre had returned to its roots when Wizards of the Coast, the new owners of the Dungeons & Dragons IP, began publishing their own cooperative fantasy adventure games based on the fourth edition of D&D: Castle Ravenloft (2010), Wrath of Ashardalon (2011), The Legend of Drizzt (2011), etc.[2]:307 Notes[edit] ^ a b Applecline, Shannon (September 2007), "Worlds of Adventure", Knucklebones, 2 (5): 88–92 ^ a b c d e Appelcline, Shannon (2014).
