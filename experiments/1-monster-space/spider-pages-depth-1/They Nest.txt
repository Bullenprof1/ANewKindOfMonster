He decides to unwind for a few months in the house he and his ex bought on Orr island, a fishing community off the coast of Maine. Here he starts examining, at the request of Sheriff Hobbs, some animal and human corpses with strange internal as well as external injuries. The doctor observes that one of the red cockroaches which recently infested the island has pincers, which is most unusual. He reads up and contacts the university entomology department, where this African species is considered obscure. He discovers that these cockroach-like insects burrow into people and nest inside them. At first, some of townspeople began to suspect that Cahill was responsible for the deaths of their friends, until they see a swarm of the mutant insects fly overhead. Now believing Cahill's story, the townspeople decide to fight back against the deadly invaders, resulting in more deaths. Cahill, his girlfriend, Nell, and two others get in a boat and try to reach the mainland, until the military is called in to deal with the problem. However, it is revealed that one of the bugs had made it to the mainland, ending the film ambiguously. References[edit] ^ Fries, Laura. "They Nest - Review". Variety. Retrieved 8 September 2020.
