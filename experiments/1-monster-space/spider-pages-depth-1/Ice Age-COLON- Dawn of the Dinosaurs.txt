Manny is determined to make life perfect and safe for both Ellie and the baby, as he doesn't want them to suffer the same fate as his previous family. At the same time, Diego debates leaving the herd because he thinks he's losing his edge and isn't meant for the family life. Sid begins to wish for a family of his own and takes three apparently abandoned eggs that he finds in an icy cave and calls them Egbert, Shelly, and Yoko. Manny tells him to put them back, but Sid ignores him and looks after the eggs, which hatch into baby Tyrannosaurus rex the next morning. Meanwhile, Scrat encounters a female flying sabertooth squirrel named Scratte, whom he battles with over the acorn. Although Sid tries his best to raise the three dinosaurs, their rambunctious behavior scares away all the younger animals and ruins the playground Manny built for his child, angering Manny. Not long after, a female Tyrannosaurus rex, whose eggs Sid stole, returns and carries both Sid and her young underground, with Diego in pursuit. Manny, Ellie, Crash and Eddie follow as well and discover that the icy cave leads to a vast subterranean jungle populated by dinosaurs thought to be extinct. Here, an angry Ankylosaurus threatens The Herd despite Diego's efforts to fend it off. Then they are saved from a further crowd of angry reptiles by a deranged, quick-witted, one-eyed weasel named Buck. Buck has been living in this jungle for quite some time and is fighting Rudy, a huge albino Baryonyx and the assumed “alpha dino”, intending to avenge the eye he lost to it when he was young with a knife he carved from one of Rudy's teeth. He agrees to lead The Herd through the jungle's perils to Lava Falls, where the dinosaur has taken Sid and her babies. In the meantime, Sid and the mother T-Rex try to outdo each other in feeding the offspring; he loses this contest but is welcomed into the family regardless. The next day, however, Sid is separated from the family and attacked by Rudy. Sid is knocked onto a loose rock slab that is floating on a river of lava and about to plummet over the falls. As The Herd moves toward Lava Falls, Ellie suddenly goes into labor and a Guanlong pack strikes, causing a rock slide that separates her from Manny and Diego. While Manny makes his way up to her, Diego assists in the delivery and fends off further attacks. Meanwhile, Buck takes Crash and Eddie to rescue Sid. Just as he goes over the falls, the trio swoops in on a commandeered Harpactognathus only to be chased by a flock of Pterodactylus on the way and saves his life. Manny reaches Ellie just in time to hear the cry of a newborn baby girl. Manny initially wants to name the baby “Ellie” after her mother but Ellie suggests the name Peaches after the fruit and the code name she and Manny agreed to use to signal when the baby is coming. Sid is saddened at the fact that he never had a chance to say goodbye to "his" children as he returns to The Herd and learns of Peaches' birth. Before they can leave the jungle, they are ambushed by Rudy, who begins to attack them at full force. Working together Manny, Sid, Diego, and Buck manage to trap Rudy by ensnaring him in vines. However, he quickly breaks free and resumes his onslaught. The Herd is saved by the timely arrival of the mother T-Rex, who charges at Rudy and knocks him off a cliff. As she and her children wish Sid well, Buck, now without a purpose in life since Rudy is gone, decides to join The Herd and live on the surface. However, a distant roar tells him that Rudy is still alive. Because of this he changes his mind and sends The Herd home, blocking off the path to the underground jungle at the same time. Manny and Ellie welcome Peaches into their frozen world and Manny admits to Sid that he did a good job looking after the dino children. Diego decides to remain with The Herd, while Buck stays underground, happily battling it out with Rudy and riding him (much to Rudy's chagrin). Meanwhile, Scrat and Scratte, who have fallen in love with one another after Scrat saved her from falling into lava, decide to live in the jungle together. Unfortunately, Scrat's greed for his precious acorn overcomes his newfound romance with Scratte, and he ultimately chooses the acorn over her (along with getting tired of her bossy ways). The two battle once more for the acorn, which results Scrat being accidentally launched back to the surface while Scratte remains behind in the dinosaur world. Scrat taunts her about the acorn, but once again loses it after a large piece of ice knocks it out of his hands back into the jungle and out of his reach. Scrat screams in frustration having lost both the acorn and Scratte. Cast[edit] Main article: List of Ice Age characters Ray Romano as Manny, a woolly mammoth and the leader of The Herd.

Character designer Peter de Sève welcomed the new plot addition, since he could not think of any other giant mammal to put into the story. The "lost world" approach led to colorful dinosaurs, because "the dinosaurs didn't have to be just brown, and you can take liberties because no one knows what color they were", according to de Sève. Rudy's design was inspired by the Baryonyx because of his crocodile-like look, which de Sève considered even more menacing than the T. rex.[5] The film was released in RealD 3D where available. This sparked some controversy when Fox announced that it would no longer pay to supply 3-D glasses to theaters,[6] leading to a number of exhibitors threatening to show the film in only standard 2-D projection.[7] The film's original trailer debuted with the film Horton Hears a Who! on March 14, 2008, then online on April 7, 2008. There are three others that have been released, with the third and fourth (which shows Buck) being the most closely resembling each other. Queen Latifah recorded a cover of the song "Walk the Dinosaur". Reception[edit] Box office[edit] The film earned $196,573,705 in North America and $690,113,112 in other territories, which gives it a worldwide gross of $886,686,817 against a budget of $90 million. Worldwide, it is the third-highest-grossing film of 2009, the highest-grossing animated film of 2009, the highest-grossing Ice Age film, the 14th-highest-grossing animated film of all time.[8] It is also the highest-grossing animated film of 2009 worldwide.[9] It set a worldwide opening-weekend record for an animated feature ($218.4 million), previously held by The Simpsons Movie ($170.9 million). However, it was later surpassed by Incredibles 2[10][11][12][13] ($235.1 million) in 2018. It is the highest-grossing film of the Ice Age series,[14] and the fifth highest-grossing film distributed by 20th Century Studios (behind Avatar, Titanic, Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace and Bohemian Rhapsody).[15] North America[edit] The film made $13,791,157 on its opening day in 4,099 theaters.[1] It reached $41,690,382 on its first weekend, putting it at number 2 behind Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, marking the lowest-grossing first weekend for the franchise, although it had a Wednesday release and therefore burned off attendance until the weekend.[14][16] The film became 20th Century Fox's third-largest 2009 release in North America behind Avatar and Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel. It is the third-highest-grossing animated feature of 2009. It heavily out-grossed its predecessor, Ice Age: The Meltdown which earned $195,330,621 three years before,[14] to become the highest-grossing movie in the franchise, but it was behind the two first Ice Age movies in estimated attendance.[17] Other territories[edit] On its opening weekend it earned $151.7 million, which is the biggest opening for an animated feature[18] and the 13th-largest of all time.[19] Outside North America, it is the fifteenth-highest-grossing film of all time[9] and the second-highest-grossing animated movie of all time (out-grossing Finding Nemo, later out-grossed by Frozen).[20] Its highest-grossing market after North America was Germany ($82.2 million), followed by France and the Maghreb region ($69.2 million), and the UK, Ireland and Malta ($56.9 million).[21] It was the highest-grossing animated film of the year in all major countries, except Spain[22] and Australia.[17][23] As of March 2012 it is the highest-grossing animated film of all time in Hungary,[24] Slovakia,[25] the Czech Republic,[26] Romania,[27] Bulgaria, where the film holds the opening-weekend record,[28] Finland,[29] Norway,[30] Denmark,[31] Estonia,[32] Latvia,[33] Lithuania,[34] Italy,[35] Greece,[36] Serbia and Montenegro,[37] Slovenia,[38] Croatia,[39] France and the Maghreb region,[40] the Netherlands,[41] Germany,[42] Austria,[43] Brazil,[44] Peru,[45] Uruguay,[46] and Venezuela.[47] Critical response[edit] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 46% based on 162 reviews and an average rating of 5.41/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs boasts some excellent animation -- in particular, the dinosaurs are wonderfully realized -- but its story is tired and monotonous."[48] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 50 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[49] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale.[50] Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four claiming that "Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is the best of the three films about our friends in the inter-species herd of plucky prehistoric heroes. And it involves some of the best use of 3-D I've seen in an animated feature."[51] Lou Lumenik of the New York Post awarded the film 3 stars stating that the film is "much more of an emphasis on action in this nicely crafted, fast-paced sequel."[52] Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club graded the film a C+ claiming the sequel "throws its commitment to the era away with movie number three, a ploy sure to anger Ice Age purists everywhere."[53] Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer enjoyed the "film's animation art is Seuss-imaginative", but panned "the flatness of the story and indifferent voicework all the more obvious."[54] Accolades[edit] The film was nominated in two categories at the 8th Visual Effects Society Awards, for "Outstanding Animation in an Animated Feature Motion Picture" and "Outstanding Animated Character in an Animated Feature Motion Picture."[55] Home media[edit] Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs was released on high-definition Blu-ray Disc and standard DVD in North America on October 27, 2009, and in the United Kingdom on November 23, 2009. Two versions of the DVD exist: a single-disc DVD, and a "Scrat Pack" double DVD pack with three Scrat games. The 3-disc Blu-ray combo pack includes a Blu-ray, the single-disc DVD, and a Digital Copy, as well as an Ice Age digital story-book maker, commentary by director Carlos Saldanha, deleted scenes, making-of featurettes, the two Scrat shorts: Gone Nutty and No Time for Nuts (that each originally came on home video for both the first and second films), and a how-to-draw Scrat tutorial with the filmmakers.
