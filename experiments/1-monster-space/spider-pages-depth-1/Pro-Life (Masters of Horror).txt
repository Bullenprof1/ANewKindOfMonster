However, her father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman) who is against abortion, and three brothers set out to ensure that the baby lives, after the father is given messages from God telling him to save the baby. In the end, Angelique gives birth to a demonic creature. The demon father (Derek Mears) rises from the ground and kills some of the staff, one of the brothers, and Dwayne (after he realizes that it was the demon who told him to save the baby). The baby is shot in the head by Angelique, as the baby recognizes her as the mother, and then the demon father, seemingly grieving over its death, goes back to Hell with the corpse. Angelique then ends the episode by saying "God's will is done." Home media[edit] The episode was released on DVD March 20, 2007. It is the eighteenth episode and the fourteenth episode to be released on DVD. There is also an alternate cover of the DVD that features a demon's hand ripping out of the bottom of a crib.
