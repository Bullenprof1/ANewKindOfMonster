The trilogy is centered on Machiko Noguchi, a human female of Japanese descent who lived and hunted with members of the Predator species. She is both intelligent and athletic, and skilled in firearms, personal defense and martial arts. After the colony of Ryushi was destroyed, Machiko desired a life of hunting but could not connect with the Predator species as they were ruthless hunters who viewed her with contempt. In result, Machiko turns against the Predators when they begin to hunt humans for sport. Aliens vs. Predator: Prey (1994)[edit] A clan of Predators (known as "Yautja" in this series) 'seeds' the planet Ryushi with a clutch of Alien Eggs, intending to hunt the adult "Drone" stage of the "Xenomorphs". Chaos ruins the carefully planned hunt when Predator and Alien encounter Ryushi's human colonists, led by reluctant corporate executive Machiko Noguchi. Aliens vs. Predator: Hunter's Planet (1997)[edit] Noguchi receives an offer by a wealthy man named Livermore Evanston to attend his own hunter paradise on the planet Blior which will be known to Noguchi as the deadliest planet of all space. Aliens vs. Predator: War (1999)[edit] On a swamp planet, entitled Bunda, Noguchi must rescue human survivors who are in the middle of the Predator raid. The events of this story take place in between Prey and Hunter's Planet.
