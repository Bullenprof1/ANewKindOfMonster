History[edit] On September 13, 1992, Bohbot Entertainment launched Amazin' Adventures, a syndicated action-oriented block that aired for two hours on Sundays. Byrne Enterprises sold barter for the block.[2] During the 1996–1997 season, Amazin' Adventures also aired for an hour on weekdays. Amazin' Adventures was re-launched as the BKN Kids Network in September 1997.[1] By 1997, the network had signed up 104 stations reaching 75% of the US, with 65 stations airing BKN in pattern and 35 stations signing on for three years. Stations that aired the BKN block included BHC Communications stations,[3] WCIU-TV,[4] WPGH-TV, and The WB 100+ Station Group. During BKN's first season, its programs were split into three blocks: the "Extreme Block" (Extreme Dinosaurs and Extreme Ghostbusters) and the "Comedy Block" (The Mask: Animated Series and Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog) on weekdays, and "Amazin’ Adventures" (Captain Simian & the Space Monkeys) on weekends.[4] On August 29, 1999, BKN was re-positioned as an action-oriented block; it was referred to internally as "Bulldog TV" because the block's bumpers featured an animated bulldog. Bulldog TV stopped airing on most stations in 2000, but The WB 100+ Station Group continued to air reruns of BKN shows during the 2000–2001 season. During this time, BKN had their shows aired on the Sci-Fi Channel on weekday mornings.
