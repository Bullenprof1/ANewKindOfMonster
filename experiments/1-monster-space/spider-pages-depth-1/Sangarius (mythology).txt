Sangarius (/sæŋˈɡɛriəs/; Ancient Greek: Σαγγάριος) was a Phrygian river-god of Greek mythology.[1] He is described as the son of Oceanus and Tethys and as the husband of Metope, by whom he became the father of Hecuba.[2][3] He is also the father of Nana and therefore the grandfather of Attis.[4] The Sakarya River (in Phrygia-Turkey) itself is said to have derived its name from one Sangas, who had offended Rhea and was punished by her by being changed into water.[5] References[edit] ^ Schmitz, Leonhard (1867).
