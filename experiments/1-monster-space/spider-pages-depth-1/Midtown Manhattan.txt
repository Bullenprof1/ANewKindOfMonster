Midtown is home to some of the city's most prominent buildings, including the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project, the headquarters of the United Nations, Grand Central Terminal, and Rockefeller Center, as well as tourist destinations such as Broadway and Times Square. Midtown Manhattan is the largest central business district in the world and ranks among the most expensive pieces of real estate; Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan commands the world's highest retail rents, with average annual rents at US$3,000 per square foot ($32,000/m2) in 2017.[5] However, due to the high price of retail spaces in Midtown, there are also many vacant storefronts in the neighborhood.[6] Midtown is the country's largest commercial, entertainment, and media center, and also a growing financial center. The majority of New York City's skyscrapers, including its tallest hotels and apartment towers, are in Midtown. The area hosts commuters and residents working in its offices, hotels, and retail establishments, tourists and students. Times Square, the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District,[7][8][9][10][11] is a major center of the world's entertainment industry.[12] Sixth Avenue also has the headquarters of three of the four major U.S. television networks. Midtown is part of Manhattan Community District 5.[2] It is patrolled by the 14th and 18th precincts of the New York City Police Department.

Midtown spans the entire island of Manhattan along an east–west axis, bounded by the East River on its east and the Hudson River to its west. The Encyclopedia of New York City defines Midtown as extending from 34th Street to 59th Street and from 3rd Avenue to 8th Avenue.[13] Neighborhoods[edit] Further information: List of Manhattan neighborhoods Madison Square Garden Times Square (2013), one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections 30 Rockefeller Plaza (former GE Building) at Rockefeller Center Skyscrapers line Sixth Avenue in the heart of Midtown "Korea Way" on 32nd Street in Manhattan's Koreatown (맨해튼 코리아타운) The United Nations Secretariat Building at the United Nations Headquarters Herald Square, with Macy's In addition to its central business district, Midtown Manhattan encompasses many neighborhoods, including Hell's Kitchen and Chelsea on the West Side, and Murray Hill, Kips Bay, Turtle Bay, and Gramercy Park on the East Side. It is sometimes broken into "Midtown East" and "Midtown West", or north and south as in the New York City Police Department's Midtown North and Midtown South precincts. Neighborhoods in the Midtown area include the following: Between 59th Street to the north and 42nd Street to the south, from west to east: Hell's Kitchen from the Hudson River to 8th Avenue, including Theatre Row on West 42nd Street between 11th Avenue and 9th Avenue, where Hell's Kitchen meets Central Park and the Upper West Side at West 59th Street and 8th Avenue, Columbus Circle Times Square and the Theater District from West 42nd Street to around West 53rd Street (according to some until Central Park at Central Park South/59th Street), and from Eighth Avenue to 6th Avenue The Diamond District on West 47th Street between 6th Avenue and 5th Avenue Midtown East from around 6th Avenue to the East River, including (going from west to east, and north to south): Sutton Place near the East River between East 53rd Street and East 59th Street Turtle Bay from 53rd Street to 42nd Street and from Lexington Avenue to the East River Tudor City from 1st Avenue to 2nd Avenue and East 40th Street to East 43rd Street Between 42nd Street north and around 34th Street, from west to east, and north to south: Hell's Kitchen from the Hudson River to 8th Avenue The Garment District from West 42nd Street to West 34th Street and from 9th Avenue to 5th Avenue Herald Square around the intersection of Broadway, Sixth Avenue, and West 34th Street Murray Hill from East 42nd Street to East 34th Street and Fifth Avenue to Second Avenue Between 34th Street and 23rd Street, from west to east: Chelsea, between the Hudson River and Sixth Avenue Koreatown from 36th Street to 31st Street and 5th and 6th Avenues centered on "Korea Way" on 32nd Street between 5th Avenue and Broadway Rose Hill or Curry Hill between Madison Avenue and 3rd Avenue Kips Bay from 3rd Avenue to the East River Between 23rd Street and 14th Street, going west to east and north to south: Chelsea, between the Hudson River and 6th Avenue The Meatpacking District in the southwesternmost corner of Midtown, to the south of West 15th Street Madison Square and the Flatiron District, the area surround the intersection of Broadway, 5th Avenue, and 23rd Street.

Manhattan Community District 5 is located from 14th to 59th Streets, generally between Lexington Avenue and Eighth Avenue. Community District 5 is largely coterminous with Midtown but also includes the Flatiron District, NoMad, Union Square, and parts of Gramercy Park and Rose Hill.[2] Midtown proper (within the boundaries of Manhattan Community District 5, and excluding overlapping neighborhoods) is located from 34th to 59th Streets between Third Avenue and Eighth Avenue.[13] The "Plaza District", a term used by Manhattan real estate professionals to denote the most expensive area of midtown from a commercial real estate perspective, lies between 42nd Street and 59th Street, from 3rd Avenue to 7th Avenue, about a square kilometer or half a square mile. "Midtown South" can refer to the part of Midtown between 23rd Street and around 42nd Street (although its northern boundary is defined differently depending on the source). "Midtown West" can refer to the area between 34th and 59th Streets, and between 5th and 12th Avenues. "Midtown East" can refer to the area between 42nd and 59th Streets, and between 5th Avenue and the East River. In 1982, the City of New York identified the "Manhattan Core" as the area that includes some of the city's most populous neighborhoods, major institutions, parks and transit hubs, and the city's primary Central Business District (CBD), defined as Manhattan below 60th Street.[14] The "Manhattan Core" includes some areas slightly further north of 86th Street in Manhattan, as well as the area below 14th Street; however, this definition is problematic because it ignores the fact that Manhattan has not one but two zones in which people do business within this area separated by a wide swath of low-rise (by New York City standards) residential development — there is Midtown (which is in Midtown Manhattan), and the Financial District, (also known simply as "Downtown" because of its location in southern Manhattan). In other sources, these districts are referred to as separate central business districts.[15] Cityscape[edit] The skyline of Midtown Manhattan, looking Downtown (south) toward Lower Manhattan, in April 2017 Economy[edit] Midtown Manhattan, along with Lower Manhattan, is one of the world's leading financial centers. Corporate headquarters[edit] Midtown Manhattan is the world's largest central business district, with 400 million square feet (37.2 million m2) of office space in 2018.[16] Midtown contains the headquarters of major companies, including 4Kids Entertainment (formerly),[17] Barnes & Noble,[18] Bloomberg L.P.,[19] Ernst & Young,[20] Calvin Klein,[21] Cantor Fitzgerald,[22] CBS Corporation,[23] Citigroup,[24] Colgate-Palmolive,[25] Cushman & Wakefield,[26] DC Comics,[27] Deloitte,[28] Duane Reade,[29] Estée Lauder Companies,[30] Foot Locker,[31] Frederator Studios,[32] JPMorgan Chase,[33] Hess Corporation,[34] Kroll Inc.,[35] L-3 Communications,[36] Marsh & McLennan Companies,[37] Marvel Entertainment,[38] MetLife,[39] MidOcean Partners,[40] Morgan Stanley,[41] NBC Universal,[42] The New York Times Company,[43] NexCen Brands,[44] Pfizer,[45] Polo Ralph Lauren,[46] Saks Incorporated (Saks Fifth Avenue),[47] The Sharper Image,[48] Simon & Schuster,[23] Six Flags,[49] TBWA Worldwide,[50] Telemundo, Thomson Reuters,[51] Time Warner,[52] Time Warner Cable,[53] The Travelers Companies, Univision Communications,[54] and Viacom.[55] The New York Institute of Finance is located in Midtown Manhattan.[56] Foreign subsidiary operations[edit] Haier operates its United States offices in the Haier Building at 1356 Broadway; the building used to be a building of the Greenwich Savings Bank. Haier held the opening ceremony on March 4, 2002.[57] Sumitomo Corporation operates its New York Office, the headquarters of the corporation's United States operations, at 600 Third Avenue, 10016 in the Murray Hill neighborhood.[58] El Al's North American headquarters are in Midtown.[59] The Air France USA regional headquarters are in 125 West 55th Street in Midtown Manhattan.[60][61] Hachette Book Group USA has its headquarters in 237 Park Avenue.[62] In 1994 Alitalia considered moving its USA headquarters from Midtown to Lower Manhattan, but decided to keep the offices where they were at the last minute.[63] Global Infrastructure Partners has an office in Midtown Manhattan.[64] Tech and biotech[edit] Silicon Alley, the common metonym for New York City's high tech sector, is based in Midtown South, specifically the Flatiron District. Prominent Silicon Alley companies in Midtown include AppNexus, Blue Apron, Gilt, Betterment, Oscar, SoFi, Rent the Runway, Warby Parker, and WeWork. The technology sector has been expanding across Midtown Manhattan since 2010.[65] The biotechnology sector is also growing in Midtown Manhattan based upon the city's strength in academic scientific research and public and commercial financial support. By mid-2014, Accelerator, a biotech investment firm, had raised more than US$30 million from investors, including Eli Lilly and Company, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson, for initial funding to create biotechnology startups at the Alexandria Center for Life Science, which encompasses more than 700,000 square feet (65,000 m2) on East 29th Street and promotes collaboration among scientists and entrepreneurs at the center and with nearby academic, medical, and research institutions. The New York City Economic Development Corporation's Early Stage Life Sciences Funding Initiative and venture capital partners, including Celgene, General Electric Ventures, and Eli Lilly, committed a minimum of US$100 million to help launch 15 to 20 ventures in life sciences and biotechnology.[66] Real estate[edit] Real estate is a major force in Midtown Manhattan's economy, and indeed the city's, as the total value of all New York City property was estimated at US$914.8 billion for the 2015 fiscal year.[67] Manhattan has perennially been home to some of the nation's, as well as the world's, most marketable real estate, including the Time Warner Center, which had the highest-listed market value in the city in 2006 at US$1.1 billion,[68] to be subsequently surpassed in October 2014 by the Waldorf Astoria New York, which became the most expensive hotel ever sold after being purchased by the Anbang Insurance Group, based in China, for US$1.95 billion.[69] When 450 Park Avenue was sold on July 2, 2007, for US$510 million, about US$1,589 per square foot (US$17,104/m2), it broke the barely month-old record for an American office building of US$1,476 per square foot (US$15,887/m2) based on the sale of 660 Madison Avenue.[70] In 2014, Manhattan was home to six of the top ten zip codes in the United States by median housing price.[71] In 2019, the most expensive home sale ever in the United States achieved completion in Midtown Manhattan, at a selling price of US$238 million, for a 24,000 square feet (2,200 m2) penthouse apartment overlooking Central Park.[72] Broadway theatre[edit] According to The Broadway League, shows on Broadway sold approximately US$1.27 billion worth of tickets in the 2013–2014 season, an increase of 11.4% from US$1.139 billion in the 2012–2013 season; attendance in 2013-2014 stood at 12.21 million, a 5.5% increase from the 2012–2013 season's 11.57 million.[73] Former economic operations[edit] The MetLife Building (formerly Pan Am Building) Companies that used to have their headquarters in Midtown Manhattan include American Airlines,[74][75] American Comics Group,[76] American Overseas Airlines,[77] Central Park Media,[78][79] Eastern Air Lines,[80] GoodTimes Entertainment,[81] LJN,[82] NewKidCo,[83] Pan American World Airways,[84] Philip Morris Companies (now Altria Group),[85][86] Trans Caribbean Airways,[87] and Trans World Airlines.[88][89][90] In 1997, Aer Lingus announced that it was moving its North American headquarters from Midtown to Melville, New York, in Suffolk County on Long Island.[91] Demographics[edit] Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Midtown Manhattan was 28,630, a change of 2,823 (9.9%) from the 25,807 counted in 2000. Covering an area of 692.81 acres (280.37 ha), the neighborhood had a population density of 41.3 inhabitants per acre (26,400/sq mi; 10,200/km2).[92] The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 64.1% (18,351) White, 4.6% (1,310) African American, 0.1% (34) Native American, 20.8% (5,942) Asian, 0% (8) Pacific Islander, 0.3% (92) from other races, and 2% (569) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 8.1% (2,324) of the population.[4] The entirety of Community District 5, which comprises Midtown Manhattan, had 53,120 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 84.8 years.[93]:2, 20 This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods.[94]:53 (PDF p. 84)[95] Most inhabitants are adults: a plurality (45%) are between the ages of 25 and 44, while 22% are between 45 and 64, and 13% are 65 or older. The ratio of youth and college-aged residents was lower, at 7% and 12% respectively.[93]:2 As of 2017, the median household income in Community Districts 4 and 5 (including Chelsea and Hell's Kitchen) was $101,981,[96] though the median income in Midtown individually was $120,854.[3] In 2018, an estimated 11% of Midtown Manhattan residents lived in poverty, compared to 14% in all of Manhattan and 20% in all of New York City. One in twenty residents (5%) were unemployed, compared to 7% in Manhattan and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 41% in Midtown Manhattan, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 45% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, as of 2018[update], Midtown Manhattan is considered to be high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.[93]:7 Police and crime[edit] NYPD 14th (Midtown South) Precinct Midtown Manhattan is patrolled by two precincts of the NYPD.[97] Midtown North is patrolled by the 18th Precinct,[a] located at 306 West 54th Street,[98] while Midtown South is patrolled by the 14th Precinct,[a] located at 357 West 35th Street.[100] The precincts ranked 69th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. The high per-capita crime rate can be attributed to the low population of the area, as well as the high number of crimes committed against tourists.[101] As of 2018[update], with a non-fatal assault rate of 25 per 100,000 people, Midtown Manhattan's rate of violent crimes per capita is less than that of the city as a whole. The incarceration rate of 297 per 100,000 people is lower than that of the city as a whole.[93]:8 The 18th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 84.2% between 1990 and 2018. The precinct reported 3 murders, 21 rapes, 130 robberies, 190 felony assaults, 175 burglaries, 1,875 grand larcenies, and 31 grand larcenies auto in 2018.[102] The 14th Precinct also has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 88.6% between 1990 and 2018.

Schwarzman Building (also the Main Branch), a reference branch at 476 Fifth Avenue. The four-story building, constructed in 1911, is known worldwide for its architecture and has several million items in its collections.[132] There are also five circulating branches in Midtown:[133][134] The 53rd Street branch is located at 18 West 53rd Street.

Mercy College is situated at Herald Square. Transportation[edit] Grand Central Terminal, seen from 42nd Street Pennsylvania Station and Grand Central Terminal are the two major railroad stations located in Midtown Manhattan. Penn Station serves Amtrak, NJ Transit, and the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), while Grand Central serves the Metro-North Railroad and will serve the LIRR in the future.[143] Penn Station is considered to be the busiest transportation hub in the Western Hemisphere, servicing around 650,000 people per day.[144][145] The Port Authority Bus Terminal is located at Eighth Avenue and 41st Street at the western edge of Midtown. The terminal is the largest in the United States and busiest in the world by volume of traffic, serving more than 65 million people per year.[146] The New York City Subway and MTA Regional Bus Operations each operate several routes that go through Midtown.
