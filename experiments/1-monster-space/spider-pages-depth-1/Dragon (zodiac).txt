The Year of the Dragon is associated with the Earthly Branch symbol 辰, pronounced chen. It has been proposed by one academic researcher that the Earthly Branch character may have been associated with scorpions; it may have symbolized the star Antares.[1] In the Buddhist calendar used in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka, the Dragon is replaced by the nāga.[2] In the Gurung zodiac, the Dragon is replaced by the eagle.[3] In Old Turkic calendar it is replaced by the fish or crocodile. Early Persian translations of the medieval period change to dragon to a sea serpent although in current times is generally refer to as whale.[4][5] Contents 1 Years and the Five Elements 2 Compatibility 3 Basic astrology elements 4 References Years and the Five Elements[edit] The Water Dragon Lantern Festival.
