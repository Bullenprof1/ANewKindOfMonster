American entertainment website, offshoot of Cracked magazine Cracked Type of site Entertainment Owner Literally Media URL www.cracked.com Launched November 2005; 15 years ago (2005-11) Cracked.com is a website based on the humorous Cracked magazine, which dates back to 1958. It was founded in 2005 by Jack O'Brien.[1][2] In 2007, Cracked had a couple of hundred thousand unique users per month and 3 or 4 million page views. In June 2011, it reached 27 million page views, according to comScore.[3][1][4][5] According to O'Brien, the site had about 17 million unique visitors and 300 million page views in February 2012.[4] Contents 1 History 2 Features 2.1 Web series 2.2 Cheat Sheets 3 Books 4 Live shows 5 Reception 6 Featured writers and editors 7 See also 8 References 9 External links History[edit] Cracked was founded as a magazine in 1958.[6][7] In early 2005, its owner Dick Kulpa sold the magazine to a group of investors who announced plans to revive a print version of Cracked with a new editorial focus and redesign.[8] In October 2005, Cracked.com launched as a separate website under editor-in-chief Jack O'Brien, a former ABC News producer.[9][10][11][12] Although the magazine folded soon after launch, the Cracked website gained popularity and was purchased by Demand Media in June 2007, setting off Cracked's rapid growth period.[4][13][14] In 2007, Cracked had a few hundred thousand unique users per month and 3 to 4 million page views.[4] The site fit well within Demand Media's network, with Jack O'Brien noting "They understand the web, and they made us nail down a voice".[15] The editorial staff includes original editor-in-chief Jack O'Brien, Jason Pargin (under his pen name, David Wong), who was added as an associate editor later in 2006, and Oren Katzeff who became Cracked.com's General Manager in November 2007 after running business development for Yahoo Media Group.[3][16] Cracked.com publishes 2–4 articles daily (2,000 – 3,000 words each), along with video content, short-form content, and contests. The feature articles are the most popular, usually pulling in around 1 million views in their first week.[17][18] In 2010, Cracked.com made an iPad app available.[19][20] The app allows users to browse Cracked's articles, videos, and contests on the iPad.[21] The app's landing page looks similar to Cracked's break room, with a soda machine, bar stools and a table.[6][21] In 2010, Cracked drew over 1 billion page views.[22][23][24] By 2012, Jack O'Brien reported over 300 million page views in February and 7.3 million unique monthly users, making it the most visited humor site in the world, ahead of The Onion, CollegeHumor, and Funny or Die.[4][5][15] Writer Daniel O'Brien was questioned by the FBI and United States Secret Service after writing an article titled "How to Kidnap the President's Daughter".[25][26] In November 2013, the Cracked web site was hacked and was unwittingly delivering malware to site visitors. The hackers injected javascript that caused malicious software to be distributed to page viewers.[27] On April 12, 2016, Cracked was purchased by the E. W. Scripps Company for $39 million.[28] In June 2017, Jack O'Brien stepped down from his position as editor-in-chief and left Cracked to build up the new comedy podcasting division at HowStuffWorks.[29][30] In October 2017, Soren Bowie left Cracked to become a writer on American Dad!, while Michael Swaim left Cracked to pursue other interests. On December 4, 2017, E. W. Scripps laid off 25 staff members from the website, including Daniel O'Brien, Cody Johnston, and the entire video team, in an effort to cut costs.[31][32] On September 10, 2019, Cracked was acquired by Literally Media, home to KnowYourMeme, Cheezburger, and eBaum's World. [33] Features[edit] The Cracked site also includes a blog, videos, forums, a writer's workshop, five weekly Image Manipulation contests called Photoplasty, and small, one-shot articles called "Quick Fixes". Cracked formerly included a daily "Craptions" contest where users added captions to odd photographs; this feature had been relegated to the forums. The site included columns by Sean "Seanbaby" Reiley, Daniel O'Brien, Robert Brockway, Cody Johnston, Soren Bowie, Chris Bucholz, host and writer of the web series Hate by Numbers Wayne Gladstone, John Cheese, Christina Hsu, and Michael Swaim, head writer and performer of the sketch comedy group "Those Aren't Muskets!". The site functions as a "virtual writer’s room", where more than 2,500 amateurs pitch articles to which other users provide feedback.[19] According to Former General Manager Oren Katzeff, "Nothing gets on the homepage without heavy editing";[3] [writers] "pitch the site’s on-staff editorial team, who give out assignments and feedback to writers after an idea is greenlit".[3] O’Brien and five other editors pick and refine the best material.[15] More than 90% of the stories on the top spot of Cracked's homepage come from the virtual writer's room.[15] Cracked is known for its popular listicles, which include titles like "The 6 Most Insane People To Ever Run For President" and "7 Basic Things You Won't Believe You're All Doing Wrong".[34] Web series[edit] About 30% of Cracked's content is video.[21][35] As of October 2014, Cracked had 22 web series exclusive to their site.[36] In 2009, Cracked debuted the web series "Agents of Cracked" which generated 20 million views over three seasons.[37] In July 2010, Cracked debuted "After Hours", a video-debate version of Cracked's lists which features four Cracked staffers discussing topics such as "Why Batman Is Secretly Terrible for Gotham" and "Why ‘Star Wars’ Is Secretly Terrifying for Women".[5] In December 2017, Cracked ended their original video productions when E.
