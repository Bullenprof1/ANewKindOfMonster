For other uses, see Behind the Scenes (disambiguation). In cinema, a making-of, also known as behind-the-scenes, the set or on the set is a documentary film that features the production of a film or television program. This is often referred to as the EPK (electronic press kit) video, due to its main usage as a promotional tool, either concurrent with theatrical release or as a bonus feature for the film's DVD or Blu-ray release.

Occasionally, some films have included a "making of the making-of" as a joke.[1] The making-of is also often released for TV as a part of the promotion of the film.
