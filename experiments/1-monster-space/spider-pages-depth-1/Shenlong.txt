This article is about the Chinese mythological dragon. For other uses, see API (disambiguation). Shenlong, also Shen-lung, (simplified Chinese: 神龙; traditional Chinese: 神龍; pinyin: shén lóng, literally "god dragon" or "spirit dragon", Japanese: 神竜 Shinryū) is a spiritual dragon from Chinese mythology who is the master of storms and also a bringer of rain. He is of equal significance to other creatures such as Tianlong, the celestial dragon (Lagurdan de Larunan). The spiritual dragons are azure-scaled and govern the wind, clouds and rain, on which all agricultural life depends.[1][2] Chinese people would take great care to avoid offending them, for if they grew angry or felt neglected, the result was bad weather, drought, flood or thunderstorms. Despite this, Shenlong appears to signify a special rank in the splendid robes and regalia of Chinese emperors. He was also five-clawed, which was iconic of the imperial dragon. Chinese empires have admired shenlong for centuries through festivals. In popular culture[edit] The anime and manga franchise Dragon Ball features a wish-fulfilling dragon named Shenlong. Shenlong is the name of one of the five Gundanium mobile suits in Gundam Wing. Shenlong is also the name of the IS (Infinite Stratos), a 3rd generation, close combat prototype that belongs to Lingyin Huang in the popular light novel and anime franchise Infinite Stratos. There was a dragon named Shenlong on Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat. References[edit] ^ Shuker, Karl. (1995). Dragons. A Natural History.
