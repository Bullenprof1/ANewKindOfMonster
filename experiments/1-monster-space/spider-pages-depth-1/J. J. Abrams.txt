He is the son of television producer Gerald W. Abrams (born 1939) and executive producer Carol Ann Abrams (née Kelvin; 1942–2012).[3] His sister is screenwriter Tracy Rosen.[3] He attended Palisades High School. After graduating from high school, Abrams planned on going to art school rather than a traditional college, but eventually enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College, following his father's advice: "it's more important that you go off and learn what to make movies about than how to make movies."[4] Film career[edit] Early career[edit] Abrams' first job in the movie business was at age 16 when he wrote the music for Don Dohler's 1982 horror movie Nightbeast. During his senior year at college, he teamed with Jill Mazursky to write a feature film treatment.[5] Purchased by Touchstone Pictures, the treatment was the basis for Taking Care of Business, Abrams' first produced film, which starred Charles Grodin and James Belushi. He followed with Regarding Henry, starring Harrison Ford, and Forever Young, starring Mel Gibson. He also co-wrote with Mazursky the script for the comedy Gone Fishin' starring Joe Pesci and Danny Glover. In 1994, he was part of the "Propellerheads" with Rob Letterman, Loren Soman, and Andy Waisler, a group of Sarah Lawrence alums experimenting with computer animation technology. They were contracted by Jeffrey Katzenberg to develop animation for the film Shrek.[6] Abrams worked on the screenplay for the 1998 film Armageddon with producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay. That same year, he made his first foray into television with Felicity, which ran for four seasons on The WB Network, serving as the series' co-creator (with Matt Reeves) and executive producer. He also composed its opening theme music. 2000s[edit] Abrams at the 2010 Time 100 Gala in Manhattan Under his production company, Bad Robot, which he founded with Bryan Burk in 2001,[7] Abrams created and executive-produced ABC's Alias and is co-creator (along with Damon Lindelof and Jeffrey Lieber) and was executive producer of Lost. As with Felicity, Abrams also composed the opening theme music for Alias and Lost. Abrams directed and wrote the two-part pilot for Lost and remained active producer for the first half of the season. Also in 2001, Abrams co-wrote and produced the horror-thriller Joy Ride.[8] In 2006, he served as executive producer of What About Brian and Six Degrees, also on ABC. He also co-wrote the teleplay for Lost's third-season premiere "A Tale of Two Cities" and the same year, he made his feature directorial debut with Mission: Impossible III, starring Tom Cruise. Abrams spoke at the TED conference in 2007.[9] In 2008, Abrams produced the monster movie Cloverfield, which Matt Reeves directed.[10] In 2009, he directed the science fiction film Star Trek,[11] which he produced with Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof. While it was speculated that they would be writing and producing an adaptation of Stephen King's The Dark Tower series of novels, they publicly stated in November 2009 that they were no longer looking to take on that project.[12] In 2008, Abrams co-created, executive produced, and co-wrote (along with Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman) the FOX science fiction series Fringe, for which he also composed the theme music. He was featured in the 2009 MTV Movie Awards 1980s-style digital short "Cool Guys Don't Look at Explosions", with Andy Samberg and Will Ferrell, in which he plays a keyboard solo. NBC picked up Abrams's Undercovers as its first new drama series for the 2010–11 season.[13] However, it was subsequently cancelled by the network in November 2010. Abrams speaking at San Diego Comic-Con International in 2010 2010s[edit] Abrams wrote and directed the Paramount science fiction thriller Super 8, starring Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning, while co-producing with Steven Spielberg and Bryan Burk; it was released on June 10, 2011.[14] Abrams directed the sequel to Star Trek, Star Trek Into Darkness, released in May 2013.[15] The film was interpreted as a loose remake of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.[16] Critics generally reacted positively to the film, while Nicholas Meyer, the director of The Wrath of Khan, called it a "gimmick".[17] Abrams was criticized for the film's treatment of classic villain Khan Noonien Singh (Benedict Cumberbatch). Many felt that much of the character, originally played by Mexican actor Ricardo Montalban, had been lost, especially his ethnic identity.[a] Two years after the film's release, Abrams said of the film, "there were certain things I was unsure of. ... Any movie ... has a fundamental conversation happening during it. And [for Into Darkness,] I didn't have it... [The weakness of the plot] was not anyone's fault but mine. ... [The script] was a little bit of a collection of scenes that were written by my friends ... And yet, I found myself frustrated by my choices, and unable to hang my hat on an undeniable thread of the main story. So then I found myself on that movie basically tap-dancing as well as I could to try and make the sequences as entertaining as possible. ... I would never say that I don't think that the movie ended up working. But I feel like it didn't work as well as it could have, had I made some better decisions before we started shooting."[19] On January 25, 2013, The Walt Disney Studios and Lucasfilm officially announced Abrams as director and producer of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the seventh entry in the Star Wars film saga.[20] It was also announced that Bryan Burk and Bad Robot Productions would produce the feature.[21] Following the news that he would direct The Force Awakens, speculation arose as to Abrams's future with Paramount Pictures, under which he had released all of his previous feature work as a director, and which had a first-look deal with his company, Bad Robot Productions. Paramount vice-chairman Rob Moore stated that Abrams would continue to have a hand in the Star Trek and Mission: Impossible franchises going forward.[22] Abrams directed, produced, and co-wrote the screenplay for The Force Awakens,[23] which opened in theaters on December 18, 2015, and grossed over $2 billion at the box office, making Abrams the first director of a $2 billion movie since James Cameron.[24][25] Despite its strong box office performance and positive reviews, the film was considered by some, including Star Wars creator George Lucas, to be too similar to the original 1977 film.[26][27] In 2016, Abrams responded towards these complaints, stating: "What was important for me was introducing brand new characters using relationships that were embracing the history that we know to tell a story that is new — to go backwards to go forwards".[28][b] Abrams returned as producer for Star Trek Beyond, released in 2016. And also produced The Cloverfield Paradox, a sequel to 10 Cloverfield Lane. It was released on Netflix in February 2018.[30][31] Also on 2018, Abrams produced Overlord, a horror film set behind German enemy lines in World War II and directed by Julius Avery.[32] Abrams also produced the fourth, fifth, and sixth Mission: Impossible films.[33] In September 2017, it was announced by Lucasfilm's president, Kathleen Kennedy, that Abrams would be returning to direct and co-write Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker with Chris Terrio.[34] The film was released in December 2019; it received mixed reviews from critics and fans,[35][36] while audience reactions leaned more positively.[37][38] Upcoming projects[edit] In 2008, it was reported that Abrams purchased the rights to a New York Times article "Mystery on Fifth Avenue" about the renovation of an 8.5 million dollar co-op, a division of property originally owned by E. F. Hutton & Co. and Marjorie Merriweather Post, for six figures and was developing a film titled Mystery on Fifth Avenue, with Paramount Pictures and Bad Robot Productions,[39] and comedy writers Maya Forbes and Wally Wolodarsky to write the adaptation. According to the article, a wealthy couple Steven B. Klinsky and Maureen Sherry purchased the apartment in 2003 and live there with their four children. Soon after purchasing the apartment, they hired young architectural designer Eric Clough, who devised an elaborately clever "scavenger hunt" built into the apartment that involved dozens of historical figures, a fictional book and a soundtrack, woven throughout the apartment in puzzles, riddles, secret panels, compartments, and hidden codes, without the couple's knowledge. The family didn't discover the embedded mystery until months after moving into the apartment.[40][41] After Abrams purchased the article, Clough left him an encrypted message in the wall tiles of a Christian Louboutin shoe store he designed in West Hollywood.[42] Abrams announced at the 2013 D.I.C.E. Summit that Bad Robot Productions had made a deal with Valve to produce a film based on either the video game title Portal or Half-Life.[43] In July 2016, Abrams reported that a fourth alternate universe Star Trek installment was in the works and that he is confident that Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Chris Hemsworth will return for the sequel.[44][45] In February 2018, HBO ordered Abrams' sci-fi drama Demimonde to series.[46] In May 2018, Abrams and Avery had reunited to produce and direct, respectively, a superhero thriller film titled The Heavy, with a script written by Daniel Casey. Paramount and Bad Robot plan to begin filming sometime in 2018.[47] Abrams will produce and Guillermo del Toro will write and direct a science-fiction action/thriller film titled Zanbato,[48] which Abrams has been working on since 2011.[49] In September 2019, Abrams and his Bad Robot Productions company signed a $250 million five-year deal with WarnerMedia, including HBO and Warner Bros. Pictures.[50] In April 2020, it was announced that Abrams would be developing three new shows for HBO Max: Justice League Dark, Overlook, and Duster.[51] Unrealized projects[edit] Main article: J. J. Abrams's unrealized projects In 1989, Abrams met Steven Spielberg at a film festival, where Spielberg spoke about a possible Who Framed Roger Rabbit sequel, with Abrams as a possible writer and with Robert Zemeckis as producer.[52] Nothing came up from this project, although Abrams has some storyboards for a Roger Rabbit short.[52] In July 2002, Abrams wrote a script for a possible fifth Superman film entitled Superman: Flyby.[53] Brett Ratner and McG entered into talks to direct,[54] although Abrams tried to get the chance to direct his own script.[55] However, the project was finally cancelled in 2004 and instead Superman Returns was released in 2006. In November 2009, it was reported that Abrams and Bad Robot Productions were producing, along with Cartoon Network Movies, Warner Bros., Frederator Films and Paramount Pictures, a film adaptation of Samurai Jack.[56] However, in June 2012, series creator Genndy Tartakovsky stated that the production of the film was scrapped after Abrams' departure from the project to direct Star Trek.[57] For this and other reasons, Tartakovsky decided to make a new season instead of a feature film. Also in 2009, it was reported that Abrams and Bad Robot Productions would produce a film based on the Micronauts toy line.[58][59] However, a film has never gone into production.[60] Other work[edit] Video game[edit] In November 2015, it was announced that Abrams was developing video game called Spyjinx, in a collaboration between Bad Robot Productions And Chair Entertainment.[61][62] Books and comics[edit] On September 9, 2013, it was announced that Abrams would release a novel, S., written by Doug Dorst. The book was released on October 29, 2013.[63] In 2019, Abrams made his debut as a writer for Marvel Comics, co-authoring the company's title Spider-Man from September of that year with his son Henry.[64] The first issue of the comic includes the death of Mary-Jane Watson, and a twelve-year time shift, with the series' protagonist being Ben Parker, son of Peter Parker and Mary Jane.[65] Personal life[edit] Abrams is married to public relations executive Katie McGrath and has three children.[5][66] His daughter, Gracie Abrams, is a pop singer-songwriter.[67] He resides in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California.[68][69] He is Jewish and his wife is Roman Catholic, and he sometimes takes his children to religious services on Jewish holidays.[70] Abrams serves on the Creative Council of Represent.Us, a nonpartisan anti-corruption organization[71] and the Motion Picture & Television Fund (MPTF) Board of Governors [72] Filmography[edit] Film[edit] Year Title Credited as Notes Director Producer Writer 1990 Taking Care of Business No No Yes Co-writer with Jill Mazursky 1991 Regarding Henry No Co-Producer Yes 1992 Forever Young No Executive Yes 1997 Gone Fishin' No No Yes Co-writer with Jill Mazursky 1998 Armageddon No No Yes Co-screenwriter with Jonathan Hensleigh 2001 Joy Ride No Yes Yes Co-writer with Clay Tarver 2006 Mission: Impossible III Yes No Yes Directorial debut; co-writer with Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci 2009 Star Trek Yes Yes No 2011 Super 8 Yes Yes Yes 2013 Star Trek Into Darkness Yes Yes No 2015 Star Wars: The Force Awakens Yes Yes Yes Co-writer with Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt 2019 Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker Yes Yes Yes Co-writer with Chris Terrio Producer only The Pallbearer (1996) The Suburbans (1999) Cloverfield (2008) Morning Glory (2010) Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011) Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015) 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) Star Trek Beyond (2016) The Cloverfield Paradox (2018) Mission: Impossible – Fallout (2018) Overlord (2018) Executive producer Infinitely Polar Bear (2014) Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) Mission: Impossible 7 (2021) Acting credits[edit] Year Title Role 1991 Regarding Henry Delivery Boy 1993 Six Degrees of Separation Doug 1996 Diabolique Video Photographer #2 1999 The Suburbans Rock Journalist 2015 Star Wars: The Force Awakens Vocal cameo 2017 The Disaster Artist Himself 2019 Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker D-O (voice) 2021 The Simpsons Himself (voice) Episode: Do Pizza Bots Dream of Electric Guitars Other roles[edit] Year Title Role 1982 Nightbeast Composer / Sound effects composer 1995 Casper Uncredited rewrites[73] 2006 Mission: Impossible III Digital artist 2019 Love, Antosha Documentary film; appears as himself Television[edit] Year Title Credited as Notes Director Executive Producer Writer Creator Theme Composer 1998–2002 Felicity Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Director (2 episodes) / Writer (17 episodes) 2001–06 Alias Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Director (3 episodes) / Writer (13 episodes) 2004–10 Lost Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Director (2 episodes) / Writer (3 episodes) 2006 Jimmy Kimmel Live!
