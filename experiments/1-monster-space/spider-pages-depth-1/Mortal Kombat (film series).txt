Animation Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures Country United States Language English Budget $48 million Box office $173 million Mortal Kombat is an American series of martial arts action films based on the fighting video game series of the same name by Midway Games. The first film was produced by Lawrence Kasanoff’s Threshold Entertainment. After two films in the series were completed, game publisher Midway filed for bankruptcy. Warner Bros., having become the parent of New Line Cinema in 2008 (after over a decade of both operating as separate divisions of Time Warner), made a bid to purchase most of Midway's assets, including Mortal Kombat. In June 2009, Kasanoff and Threshold sued in bankruptcy court, arguing that they owned the copyright to many of the characters from the series.[1] On July 1, 2009, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of most of Midway's assets to Warner Bros.[2] subject to the intellectual property claims of Threshold Entertainment.[3] Contents 1 Films 1.1 Live-action 1.1.1 Mortal Kombat (1995) 1.1.2 Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997) 1.1.3 Mortal Kombat (2021) 1.2 Animated 1.2.1 Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins (1995) 1.2.2 Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge (2020) 2 Cast and crew 2.1 Cast 2.2 Crew 3 Reception 3.1 Box office performance 3.2 Critical and public response 4 Music 4.1 Soundtracks 5 Novelizations 6 References 7 External links Films[edit] Live-action[edit] Film U.S. release date Director(s) Screenwriter(s) Story by Producer(s) Original series Mortal Kombat August 18, 1995 Paul W.
