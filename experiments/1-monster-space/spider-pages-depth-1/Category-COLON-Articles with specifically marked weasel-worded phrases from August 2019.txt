Expression error: Unrecognized word "api". Update this page 0% completed (estimate)     This is a maintenance category, used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project. It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages, or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories. This is a tracking category. It builds and maintains a list of pages primarily for the sake of the list itself. They are not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme. This category is hidden on its member pages—unless the corresponding user preference (appearance → show hidden categories) is set. These categories are used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse" (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list (discriminated by classifications). This template should only be transcluded in the category namespace(s). This category combines all from 00 API (API-00) to enable us to work through the backlog more systematically. It is a member of [[:Category:]]. Here are the message pages. Some may be {{Null}} Note that Type messages will be used if they exist, whereas Main messages will be used if there is no message parameter. This is because it is always possible to create a default type message, and it is never possible to create a default (non-null) main message. Type messages have the parameters month name , year and cat available to them. Main messages have month name and year. Messages are called from Template:Monthly clean-up category/core Type messages[edit] Main messages[edit]
