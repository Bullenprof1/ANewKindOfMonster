The pages in this category are redirects to related topics, e.g. "2016 Paris flood" is a topic related to "2016 European floods". To add a redirect to this category, place {{Rcat shell|{{R to related topic}}}} on the second new line (skip a line) after #REDIRECT [[Target page name]]. For more information follow the links. Never substitute redirect template(s), nor place them on soft redirects. See also the complete list of redirect templates and the redirect style guide. This is a maintenance category, used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project. It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages, or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories. This is a tracking category. It builds and maintains a list of pages primarily for the sake of the list itself. They are not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme. This category is hidden on its member pages—unless the corresponding user preference (appearance → show hidden categories) is set. These categories are used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse" (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list (discriminated by classifications). This template should only be transcluded in the category namespace(s). The main difference between these topic redirects and redirects from related words is that these are more likely to become articles someday, where related words likely will not.
