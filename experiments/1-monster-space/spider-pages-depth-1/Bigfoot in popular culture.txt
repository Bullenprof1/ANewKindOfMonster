The fact that this legislation was passed on April 1 did not escape notice, but County Commissioner Conrad Lundy said that "this is not an April Fool's Day joke ... there is reason to believe such an animal exists."[71] The ordinance was amended in 1984 to preclude an insanity defense and to consider such a killing homicide if the creature was proven by a coroner to be humanoid.[71][72] The Skamania County ordinance speculates on whether or not Bigfoot is a subspecies of Homo sapiens.[72] Whatcom County, Washington passed a bill on June 9, 1991, which declared Whatcom County a "Sasquatch Protection and Refuge Area".[73] Literature[edit] Like film and television, Bigfoot is a common subject of literature appearing in a variety of genres.

The song's lyrics include, "I still believe in Bigfoot/Don't care what they say/Still believe in apple pie and the good ol' U.S.A," and were written in response to a news article following the death of Ray Wallace, the man who claimed responsibility for finding Bigfoot evidence. The article quoted Wallace's son stating that his father had perpetrated a hoax, carving the footprints himself. The song highlights the desire of many Bigfoot enthusiasts to believe in Bigfoot, regardless of scientific evidence or lack thereof.[citation needed] The song "Bigfoot" by the Winnipeg indie-rock band The Weakerthans is about the frustration and humiliation of a man who is purported to have seen a Bigfoot.[83] The pop punk band Groovie Ghoulies released a song in 1997 about Bigfoot called "Running with Bigfoot".[84] The musician "Saxsquatch" has had a number of viral videos where he, dressed in a Sasquatch costume, performs solo saxophone routines.
