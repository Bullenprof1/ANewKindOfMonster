August Derleth placed it at 49°51′S 128°34′W﻿ / ﻿49.850°S 128.567°W﻿ / -49.850; -128.567.

There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults. — H. P. Lovecraft, "The Call of Cthulhu" (1928) R'lyeh is characterized by bizarre architecture likened to non-Euclidean geometry. Norwegian sailor Gustaf Johansen, the narrator of one of the tales in the short story, describes the accidental discovery of the city: "a coast-line of mingled mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the tangible substance of earth's supreme terror—the nightmare corpse-city of R'lyeh...loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours".[2] The short story also asserts the premise that while currently trapped in R'lyeh, Cthulhu will eventually return, with worshipers often repeating the phrase Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn: "In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming".[2] Lovecraft claims R'lyeh is located at 47°9′S 123°43′W﻿ / ﻿47.150°S 123.717°W﻿ / -47.150; -123.717﻿ (R'lyeh fictional location (Lovecraft))Coordinates: 47°9′S 123°43′W﻿ / ﻿47.150°S 123.717°W﻿ / -47.150; -123.717﻿ (R'lyeh fictional location (Lovecraft)) in the southern Pacific Ocean.[2] Writer August Derleth, a contemporary correspondent of Lovecraft, placed R'lyeh at 49°51′S 128°34′W﻿ / ﻿49.850°S 128.567°W﻿ / -49.850; -128.567﻿ (R'lyeh fictional location (Derleth)).[3] The latter coordinates place the city approximately 5,100 nautical miles (9,400 km) from the actual island of Pohnpei (Ponape), the location of the fictional "Ponape Scripture". Both locations are close to the Pacific pole of inaccessibility ( 48°52.6′S 123°23.6′W﻿ / ﻿48.8767°S 123.3933°W﻿ / -48.8767; -123.3933﻿ (Oceanic Pole of Inaccessibility)), the point in the ocean farthest from any land mass.
