Galene (Greek: Γαλήνη) in ancient Greek religion was a minor goddess personifying calm seas. Hesiod enumerates her as one of the Nereids,[1] while Euripides mentions "Galaneia" as a daughter of Pontus.[2] Callimachus refers to her as "Galenaia".[3] A statue of Galene, next to that of Thalassa, was mentioned by Pausanias as an offering at the temple of Poseidon in Corinth.[4] The alternative name Galatea, which gained currency in the 18th century refers to same goddess.[5] See also[edit] List of Greek mythological figures References[edit] ^ Theogony, 244 ^ Helen, 1457 ^ Callimachus, Epigrams 6 (from Athenaeus 7. 318) ^ Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 1. 9 ^ Meyer Reinhold, "The Naming of Pygmalion's Animated Statue" The Classical Journal 66.4 (1971), pp. 316-319 This article relating to Greek mythology is a stub.
