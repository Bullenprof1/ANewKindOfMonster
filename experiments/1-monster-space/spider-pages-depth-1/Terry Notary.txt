His parents enrolled him in gymnastics class to burn off excess energy.[3] He won a gymnastics scholarship at UCLA, where he graduated with a major in theatre. Career[edit] Notary's first career was as a performer with Cirque du Soleil. His first job as a stunt movement coach was on Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Director Ron Howard was hiring Cirque gymnasts for the film, and after sufficiently impressing Howard, Notary was offered the job of teaching all the actors how to move.[4] Notary followed this new career path to Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes, for which he prepared by studying ape movements at the LA County Zoo. Notary's first motion capture film was Avatar, where he was the movement coach for the Na'vi.[5] Swedish director Ruben Östlund hired Notary when casting his Palme d'Or-winning 2017 film The Square. For Oleg, a character who acts like an ape, Östlund discovered Notary after running a Google search for "actor imitating monkey" and viewing one of Notary's performances (which was for an audition for Planet of the Apes).[6] His performance in that single scene, in which a performance artist acts like a hostile ape at a fancy dinner, was widely praised, The Independent calling it "the most tense, uncomfortable scene of the year."[7][8][9][10] Filmography[edit] Year Title Stunt work Role 2000 Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas Stunt performer / movement coach N/A 2001 The Animal Stunt performer N/A Planet of the Apes Stunt performer / Tim Roth's stunt double (uncredited) / movement coach Various Ape Extras The Hot Chick Stunt performer N/A 2003 X2 Stunt performer / movement coach N/A Tarzan Animal movement coach N/A 2004 The Village Movement coach N/A 2005 Me and You and Everyone We Know Stunt co-ordinator N/A 2006 Superman Returns Stunt performer / movement coach N/A 2007 If I Had Known I Was A Genius Stunt co-ordinator N/A Slipstream Stunt co-ordinator (uncredited) N/A Next Stunt double (uncredited)/ movement coach (uncredited) N/A Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer Stunt performer / Silver Surfer MoCap performer / movement coach N/A 2008 The Incredible Hulk Movement coach / Tim Roth's stunt double (uncredited) / Hulk & Abomination MoCap performers Soldier (uncredited) 2009 The Forgotten Ones Stunt co-ordinator Alpha Creature Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen Movement coach N/A Avatar Stunts / MoCap performer/ movement coach Banshee (uncredited) 2010 The Lost Tribe Executive producer/ stunt co-ordinator/ movement coach Alpha Male Primal Stunt co-ordinator N/A 2011 Attack the Block Movement coach Head Alien Rise of the Planet of the Apes Stunt co-ordinator / Andy Serkis & Richard Ridings's stunt double / movement coach Rocket / Bright Eyes The Adventures of Tintin Stunt co-ordinator/ stunt performer / MoCap performer / movement coach N/A The Cabin in the Woods Stunt performer / movement coach Clown 2012 The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey MoCap performer/ movement coach Goblin 2013 The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug Stunt performer / movement coach Goblin / Yazneg (pick-up shots) 2014 Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Stunt co-ordinator / movement coach Rocket The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies Movement coach Laketown Refugee 2016 Warcraft Stunt coordinator / movement coach Grommash Hellscream 2017 Kong: Skull Island MoCap performer King Kong War for the Planet of the Apes Stunt co-ordinator / movement coach Rocket The Square Actor Oleg 2018 Avengers: Infinity War Groot MoCap performer[11] Cull Obsidian (motion capture and voice) 2019 Avengers: Endgame The Lion King MoCap performer N/A Doctor Sleep Stunt performer / movement coach N/A 2020 The Call of the Wild MoCap performer Rail Worker / Buck 2021 Godzilla vs. Kong MoCap performer King Kong (uncredited) 2022 Thor: Love and Thunder Groot MoCap performer N/A References[edit] ^ SensaCine.
