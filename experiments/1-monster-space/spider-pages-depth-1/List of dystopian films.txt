Wikipedia list article Not to be confused with List of apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction. This is a list of dystopian films. A dystopia (from the Greek δυσ- and τόπος, alternatively, cacotopia,[1] kakotopia, cackotopia, or anti-utopia) is an imaginary community or society, that is undesirable or frightening.[2][3] The literal translation, from its Greek origin into the English language, reads as "not-good place"; an antonym of utopia. Dystopian societies appear in many artistic works, most notably, in stories set in a future time-period. Dystopias are often characterized by dehumanization,[2] totalitarian governments, ruthless megacorporations, environmental disaster,[3] or other characteristics associated with a dramatic decline in society. Dystopian societies appear in many subgenres of fiction, oftentimes being used to draw attention to potential or real-world trends combined with societal issues. Examples of popular topics include: environmental, cultural, political, economical, religious, psychological, ethical, scientific, and technological issues; all of which, if left unaddressed, have the potential outcome of a dystopia.
