Black Canyon City is located in southern Yavapai County and is approximately 22 miles north of Phoenix. Included in the southern part of Black Canyon City is the community of Rock Springs.[5] It is served by Interstate 17, which bisects the city. I-17 is the main north-south freeway between Phoenix and Flagstaff. The Agua Fria river runs right through the center of Black Canyon City and the river empties into Lake Pleasant to the southwest. Black Canyon City is becoming a bedroom exurb of Phoenix with the continued rapid growth of Phoenix northward.[citation needed] The assessed value of Black Canyon City property more than doubled between 2000 and 2007.[6] History[edit] Black Canyon City has been known by several names in the past, including Goddard or Goddards, Cañon, and Black Canyon. Goddard's was a stage stop on the Phoenix to Prescott line, a military stopover en route to Fort Whipple and Fort Verde during Territorial days, and a supply center for mines in the southern Bradshaw Mountains. The area was first settled by people of Anglo-European origin in the 1870s, and the first post office was established as Cañon in May 1894, with postmaster Charles E. Goddard, and was discontinued in October 1899. It was reestablished again from February 1903 to November 1906.[7]:89 An early settler was Jack Swilling and his wife Trinidad Swilling, who moved there in 1871. The walls of his ranch house, Swillings Cabin, the oldest building in the community, still stand.[6][8] In 2004, residents proposed incorporating the area as a town and submitted sufficient signatures to hold an election.[9] However, the initiative failed with 71.78% voting against incorporation.[10] Demographics[edit] Historical population Census Pop. %± 1990 1,811 — 2000 2,697 48.9% 2010 2,837 5.2% U.S. Decennial Census[11] Black Canyon City first appeared on the 1990 U.S. Census as a census-designated place (CDP).[12] As of the census[13] of 2000, there were 2,697 people, 1,241 households, and 771 families residing in the CDP.

Superior water Quality standards[edit] Black Canyon City, in common with such other Yavapai county communities as Camp Verde, Cornville, Rimrock and Village of Oak Creek, has well water exceeding the current maximum limit of 10 ppb arsenic. Two thirds of the Black Canyon City residents and most of the businesses are served by a water District. The remaining residents are served by a private water company. Both water systems have invested heavily in arsenic treatment facilities and the water in Black Canyon City fully meets all federal standards. Both are continuously monitored by [1] ADEQ Public safety[edit] Police protection in the Black Canyon City area is the responsibility of the Southern Area Command of the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office.[14] Notable people[edit] Jacob Snively (1809-1871), a surveyor, civil engineer, officer of the Texian Army and the Army of the Republic of Texas, California 49er, miner, and Arizona pioneer.
