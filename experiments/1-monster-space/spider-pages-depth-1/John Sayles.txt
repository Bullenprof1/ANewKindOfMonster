Sayles earned a B.A. in psychology in 1972.[3] Career[edit] After college, Sayles moved to Boston where he worked a variety of blue-collar jobs while writing short stories for The Atlantic.[4] These writings culminated in his first novel, The Pride of the Bimbos, published in 1975. Like Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola, Sayles began his film career working with Roger Corman. In 1979, Sayles used $30,000 he earned writing scripts for Corman to fund his first film, Return of the Secaucus 7.[5] To make the film on a limited budget, he set the film in a large house so that he did not have to travel to or get permits for different locations, set the story over a three-day weekend to limit costume changes, and wrote about people his age so he could cast his friends in it. The film received near-unanimous critical acclaim at the time and has held its reputation. In November 1997, the National Film Preservation Board announced that Return of the Secaucus 7 would be one of the 25 films selected that year for preservation in the National Film Registry at the Library of Congress. In 1983, after the films Baby It's You (starring Rosanna Arquette) and Lianna (a story in which a married woman becomes discontented with her marriage and falls in love with another woman), Sayles received a MacArthur Fellowship. He put the money into the science fiction feature The Brother from Another Planet,[6] a film about a three-toed humanoid who escapes bondage on another world and crash-lands in New York harbour; because he is Africanoid in appearance, he finds himself at home among the people of Harlem, being pursued by European-looking alien enslavers men in black. Sayles at the Miami Book Fair International, 2011 In 1989, Sayles created and wrote the pilot episode for the short-lived television show Shannon's Deal about a down-and-out Philadelphia lawyer played by Jamey Sheridan. Sayles received a 1990 Edgar Award for his teleplay for the pilot. The show ran for 16 episodes before being cancelled in 1991. Sayles has funded most of his films by writing genre scripts, such as Piranha, Alligator, The Howling, and The Challenge[7] Having collaborated with Joe Dante on Piranha and The Howling, Sayles acted in Dante's movie, Matinee. Sayles gets the rest of his funding by working as a script doctor; he did rewrites for Apollo 13[8] and Mimic. A genre script, called Night Skies, inspired what would eventually become the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.[9] That film's director, Steven Spielberg, later commissioned Sayles to write a script (unused) for the fourth Jurassic Park film. He has written and directed his own films, including Lone Star, Passion Fish, Eight Men Out, The Secret of Roan Inish, and Matewan. He serves on the advisory board for the Austin Film Society.[10] Maggie Renzi has been John Sayles' long-time companion (and collaborator), but they have not married. Renzi has produced most of his films since Lianna. They met as students at Williams College. Sayles works with a regular repertory of actors, most notably Chris Cooper, David Strathairn, and Gordon Clapp, each of whom has appeared in at least four of his films. In early 2003, Sayles signed the Not In Our Name "Statement of Conscience" (along with Noam Chomsky, Steve Earle, Brian Eno, Jesse Jackson, Viggo Mortensen, Bonnie Raitt, Oliver Stone, Marisa Tomei, Susan Sarandon and others) which opposed the invasion of Iraq[11] In February 2009, Sayles was reported to be writing an HBO series based on the early life of Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The drama, tentatively titled Scar Tissue, centers on Kiedis's early years living in West Hollywood with his father. At that time, Kiedis's father, known as Spider, sold drugs (according to legend, his clients included The Who and Led Zeppelin) and mingled with rock stars on the Sunset Strip, all while aspiring to get into show business.[12] In February 2010, Sayles began shooting his 17th feature film, the historical war drama Amigo, in the Philippines. The film is a fictional account of events during the Philippine–American War, with a cast that includes Joel Torre, Chris Cooper, and Garret Dillahunt.[13] His novel A Moment in the Sun, set during the same period as Amigo, in the Philippines, Cuba, and the U.S., was released in 2011 by McSweeney's. It includes an account of the Wilmington Insurrection of 1898 in North Carolina, the only coup d'état in United States history in which a duly elected government was overthrown.[14] Legacy and honors[edit] 1983 MacArthur Fellowship 1990 Edgar Award, for teleplay for pilot of Shannon's Deal In June 2014, Sayles donated his non-film archive to the University of Michigan. It will be accessible at the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library. Sayles's film archive is held by the UCLA Film and Television Archive.[15] Filmography[edit] Writer/director[edit] Return of the Secaucus 7 (1980) Lianna (1983) Baby It's You (1983) The Brother from Another Planet (1984) Matewan (1987) Eight Men Out (1988) (Also actor portraying Ring Lardner) City of Hope (1991) Passion Fish (1992) The Secret of Roan Inish (1994) Lone Star (1996) Men with Guns (1997) Limbo (1999) Sunshine State (2002) Casa de los Babys (2003) Silver City (2004) Honeydripper (2007) Amigo (2010) Go for Sisters (2013) Writer (film)[edit] Piranha (1978) The Lady in Red (1979) Alligator (1980) Battle Beyond the Stars (1980) The Howling (1981) The Challenge (with Richard Maxwell) (1982) E.T. the Extra Terrestrial (early draft, then titled Night Skies) Enormous Changes at the Last Minute (with Susan Rice) (1983) The Clan of the Cave Bear (1986) Wild Thing (1987) Breaking In (1989) Men of War (as A Safe Place, later repolished by Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris) (1994) Apollo 13 (1995) (uncredited rewrite) The Spiderwick Chronicles (Co-writer with David Berenbaum and Karey Kirkpatrick) (2008) The Devil's Highway (2018) Writer (TV)[edit] A Perfect Match (with Mel Damski) (1980) Unnatural Causes (1986) Shannon's Deal (1989) (Creator) The Alienist (2018) Actor (film)[edit] Return of the Secaucus 7 (as Howie) (1980) Lianna (as Jerry) (1983) The Brother from Another Planet (as Man in Black #2) (1984) Something Wild (as Motorcycle Cop) (1986) Matewan (as Hardshell Preacher) (1987) Eight Men Out (as Ring Lardner) (1988) City of Hope (as Carl) (1991) Matinee (as Bob) (1993) Gridlock'd (1996) In the Electric Mist (as Michael Goldman) (2009) The Normals (as Dr. Marx) (2012) Bibliography[edit] Novels[edit] Pride of the Bimbos (1975) (novel) Union Dues (1977) (novel) Los Gusanos (1991) (novel) A Moment in the Sun (2011) (novel) Yellow Earth (2020) (novel)[16] Collections and non-fiction[edit] The Anarchists' Convention (1979) (short story collection) Thinking in Pictures: The Making of the Movie "Matewan" (1987) (non-fiction) Dillinger in Hollywood (2004) (short story collection) Music videos[edit] Bruce Springsteen – "Born in the U.S.A."[17] Bruce Springsteen – "I'm on Fire"[18] Bruce Springsteen – "Glory Days" Awards/nominations[edit] This section of a biography of a living person does not include any references or sources.
