Quote: "Science fiction films often turn to satire to comment on contemporary trends. Dr Strangelove satirizes the politicians and scientists who plot nuclear war; Woody Allen's Sleeper (1973) brings a slapstick sensibility to the story of a contemporary man who awakens to find himself in a strange future world; and Paul Verhoeven's Robocop (1987) satirically comments upon the casual violence and corruption of its future world even as it indulges in a violent spectacle of its own." ^ Webley SJ, Zackariasson P (2019). The Playful Undead and Video Games: Critical Analyses of Zombies and Gameplay. Routledge. ISBN 9781351716512. Quote: "Resident Evil 5 (Capcom, 2009) faced accusations of racism in its depiction of African zombies (Brock 2011; Pham 2009; Goldstein 2009), suggesting that the undead are not quite 'other' enough to alleviate moral and social concerns. This is an ironic turn in zombies' popular culture history, perhaps, given the satirical intentions of George A. Romero's original zombie movie, Night of the Living Dead (The Walter Reade Organization, 1968). The film was released just six months after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., and Romero sought to cast non-white actors in significant roles and went so far as to depict the lynching and murder of a key black character at the film's conclusion." ^ Knöppler, Christian (2017).

Quote: "[E]xamining the film's satiric treatment of American capitalism and, by extension, a global economic order predicated upon class exploitation. Indeed, the economic system depicted in Land of the Dead has a remarkable parallel with Marx's representation of capitalist society. [...] THe besieged house is transformed into an entire city allegorically representing America and its relationship to the underdeveloped, exploited nations on the periphery of empire." ^ Cowdell S, Fleming C, Hodge J (2015).
