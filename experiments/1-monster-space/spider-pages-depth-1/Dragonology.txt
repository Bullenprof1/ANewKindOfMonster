The series later expanded to include figures and models, a strategic board game, card game, and a video game for the Nintendo DS. Books in the series are credited to fictional authors such as Dr Ernest Drake, a member of the Secret and Ancient Society of Dragonologists, and the author of the series' first book, Dragonology: The Complete Book of Dragons. The series first launched in 2003 the United States and Canada by Candlewick Press and in the United Kingdom by Templar Publishing.[2] The publishers would eventually publish books with similar themes on the topics of wizardry, Egyptology, pirates, and monsters.[3] In 2012 Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman announced that they intended to produce a film adaptation of the books.[4] Contents 1 Products 1.1 Books 1.2 Book-sets 1.3 Sets, Games, and Toys 2 See also 3 References 4 External links Products[edit] The products are published in the United States and Canada by Candlewick Press and in the United Kingdom by Templar Publishing.
