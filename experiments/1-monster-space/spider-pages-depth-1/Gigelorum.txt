Gigelorum (or Giol-Daoram) is an insect of Scottish folklore. It was believed to be the smallest creature. No description or information is available about it except that it inhabits the ear of a mite.[1] Speculation exists that it may be based upon the tiniest insect that can be discerned by people possessing excellent eyesight, the giolcam-daobhram, which is described as "an animalcule, the smallest supposable living thing".[2] Ronald Black, a one time Celtic studies lecturer, author and journalist,[3] suggests that the creature could be a figment of the imagination of folklorist and Tiree minister John Gregorson Campbell as he could trace no authoritative sources for it.[2] References[edit] Citations ^ Gregorson Campbell (1900), p. 220 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFGregorson_Campbell1900 (help) ^ a b Gregorson Campbell (2005), p. 375 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFGregorson_Campbell2005 (help) ^ Martin Devine & Logue (2002), p. 23 sfnp error: no target: CITEREFMartin_DevineLogue2002 (help) Bibliography Martin Devine, Thomas; Logue, Paddy (2002), Being Scottish: Personal Reflections on Scottish Identity Today, Edinburgh University Press, ISBN 978-1-902930-36-7 Gregorson Campbell, John (1900), Superstitions of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, James MacLehose Gregorson Campbell, John (2005) [1990 & 1902], Black, Ronald (ed.), The Gaelic Otherworld: Superstitions of the Highlands and the Islands and Witchcraft and Second Sight in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, Birlinn, ISBN 978 1 84158 207 8 – via Questia Online Library v t e Celtic mythology series Creatures in Scottish mythology and folklore Beasts Beithir Gigelorum Birds Boobrie Deities Beira Cailleach Fairies/spirits Aos Sí Baobhan sith Bean nighe Biasd Bheulach Blue men of the Minch Bodach Caoineag Cat sìth Changeling Cù Sìth Each-uisge Fuath Ghillie Dhu Glaistig Kelpie Meg Mullach Nuggle Sea Mither Seonaidh Water bull Giants Fachan Gnomes Pech Goblins/hobgoblins Bauchan Mermaids Ceasg Selkie This Scotland-related article is a stub.
