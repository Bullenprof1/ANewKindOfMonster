Newspaper Yidishes tageblat (יידישעס טאגעבלאט) was founded in 1906 by Zionist Samuel Jackan, a former contributor to the Hebrew language paper Ha-Tsefirah. In 1908 Yidishes tageblat changed its name to Haynt and quickly established itself as the premier Yiddish newspaper in the Congress Poland.[1] The practice of reprinting Yiddish fiction in serialized form helped Haynt set new circulation records for Yiddish journalism. By 1913 the newspaper reached a circulation of more than 150,000 copies.[2] From 1908 till 1932 Haynt was a private company. In 1932 a cooperative called Alt-Nay was formed by the staff, who administered the newspaper ever since.[3] Title page of Haynt, January 17, 1915 Contributors[edit] Esriel Carlebach (עזריאל קארלעבאך), also under pseudonym Levi Gotthelf (לוי גאָטהעלף).
