In the 1920s he branched out to producing and directing films but they were not a success.[3] He produced, directed and played the lead role in his productions of Livingstone (1925) and Robinson Crusoe (1927). A planned biography of Lawrence of Arabia called Revolt in the Desert to be photographed by Freddie Young who had photographed his war films The Somme (1927) and Victory (1928) did not eventuate.[4][5] He was responsible for the hoax "surgeon's photograph" of the Loch Ness Monster. He was the father of actor Ian Colin.
