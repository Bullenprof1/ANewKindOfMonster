(née Swarens) Corsaut. She majored in drama at Northwestern University and studied acting with Lee Strasberg.[2] During her junior year, Corsaut dropped out to pursue a career in acting, although during the run of The Andy Griffith Show, Corsaut took courses at UCLA with plans to earn her degree.[3] She began her acting career in New York City in the mid-1950s.[4] In 1958, Corsaut and Steve McQueen made their film debuts in the independent cult horror film The Blob.[5] On television, in 1961–1962, she portrayed Irma Howell on the CBS sitcom Mrs. G. Goes to College.[4] Corsaut first appeared on the long-running Griffith show in 1963 as schoolteacher Helen Crump, who later became the Mayberry sheriff's wife on the first episode of the spinoff Mayberry R.F.D. In 1965 she was also cast as Kathy McLennan, the young widow of a rancher, in the episode "Paid in Full" on the syndicated Western anthology series Death Valley Days.[6] Corsaut later had a continuing role as policeman Bumper Morgan's pawn-shop-owner friend on the 1975–1976 series The Blue Knight.[4] In the series Adam-12, Corsaut portrayed Officer Pete Malloy's girlfriend Judy. She had a supporting role too as Head Nurse Bradley in the 1980s sitcom House Calls, and she appeared in several episodes of Matlock with star Andy Griffith.[7] In addition, Corsaut played the role of nurse Jesse Brewer in 1977 on the long-running ABC soap opera General Hospital when long-time portrayer Emily McLaughlin was too ill to work.[8] She returned to the role of Helen Crump in the reunion shows Return to Mayberry in 1986 and The Andy Griffith Show Reunion in 1993.[4] As a writer, she coauthored The Mystery Reader's Quiz Book.[4][9] Personal life and death[edit] Corsaut never married or had any children. According to the 2015 book Andy & Don: The Making of a Friendship and a Classic American TV Show, she and Andy Griffith, who was married at the time, had an affair while working together on The Andy Griffith Show.[10] On November 6, 1995,[citation needed] Corsaut died of cancer in Los Angeles, California, just three days after her 62nd birthday.[1][4] A Catholic, she was interred at Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery in nearby North Hollywood.[11] Filmography[edit] Film[edit] Year Title Role Notes 1958 The Blob Jane Martin 1964 Good Neighbor Sam Fran Uncredited 1965 A Rage to Live Mary Uncredited 1974 Blazing Saddles Tourist Mother Uncredited 1978 The Toolbox Murders Joanne Ballard Television[edit] Year Title Role Notes 1955 Producers' Showcase "The Fourposter" 1955 Robert Montgomery Presents "Man Lost" 1959 Black Saddle Mary Warren "Client: Peter Warren" 1960 Unsolved Gloria TV movie 1960 Johnny Ringo Lettie Frome "Black Harvest" 1960 Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater Amy "Ransom" 1960 Guestward, Ho!
