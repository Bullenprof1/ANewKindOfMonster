There are now two co-editors-in-chief: Josh Millican, and Alyse Wax.[6] Website[edit] The site's staff use horror-themed aliases. The website has a broad focus, and it covers both mainstream and fringe topics that range from horror films to comics to toys. Besides reviews and news, they also host several podcasts.[7] Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times states, "if it gushes blood or desecrates flesh, Dread Central covers it."[8] The site is oriented toward a male demographic and favors edgy, exploitative films.[8] After 10 years, Dread Central became reader-supported via Patreon.[9] This would make Dread Central the first genre news site to switch from being ad-supported to being crowd supported.[10] Celebrity supporters include John Carpenter,[10] Gale Anne Hurd,[10] Sid Haig,[11] Adam Green,[11] and Darren Lynn Bousman.[12] Other ventures[edit] In 2007, Dread Central and VersusMedia announced Horror D'Oeuvres, a competition for independent short films.[13][14] In 2008, the site partnered with several other prominent horror sites and studios in a horror-themed auction to raise money for the Entertainment Industry Foundation.[15] In 2013, they partnered with Gas Lamp Museum and the San Diego Ghost Hunters to organize a ghost hunt at the William Heath Davis House. The proceeds went toward upkeep for the historic site.[16] Also in 2013, they began offering the "Box of Dread", a random package full of merchandise delivered monthly to subscribers, one of whom is randomly chosen to receive a "special edition" valued at $250.[17] CineMayhem[edit] Main article: CineMayhem CineMayhem, a film festival for independent genre films, was founded by Heather Wixson in association with Dread Central's Indie Horror Month.

The independent studio announced it would be launching a new distribution label specializing in horror films released in theaters and on demand.[22][23] On January 29, 2019, the label was renamed DREAD. Their first in-house produced film, The Golem, will be the first film under the DREAD Originals banner.[24][23] Book of Monsters Director's Cut Extremity The Golem Imitation Girl Lasso The Lodgers Slay Belles Terrifier To Hell and Back: The Kane Hodder Story Vidar the Vampire Villmark Asylum Zombiology: Enjoy Yourself Tonight Zone of the Dead Reception[edit] Dread Central was chosen as AMC's Site of the Week, in 2008.[7] It was nominated for Total Film's Best Horror Blog, in 2010.[25] It won the Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Award for Best Website for the years 2009-2012.[26][27][28][29] References[edit] ^ Barton, Steve (2013-07-04).
