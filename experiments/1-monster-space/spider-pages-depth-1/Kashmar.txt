It seems that this is the only miracle of this prophet that there are many legends about it.[4] Achaemenids[edit] The Achaemenids attached great importance to the Zoroastrianism religion, which led to the prosperity of the city. Parthians[edit] The Parthians, and before them, the Seleucids, attached great importance to the religion of Zoroastrianism, and paid great attention to Cypress of Kashmar, which was considered a relic of Zoroaster. The regions of Kashmar and Nishapur were considered fertile areas of Iran during the Parthian Empire.[5] Sasanians[edit] According to the Paikuli inscription, during the Sasanian Empire, Kashmar was part of Greater Khorasan, and the Sasanians worked hard to revive the ancient religion. It still remains a few kilometers above the ancient city of Kashmar in the castle complex of Atashgah. The ruins of this fort are now located 5 to 6 km (3.1 to 3.7 mi) northwest of Kashmar and are considered Sasanian monuments.[5] Islamic era[edit] In 520 AH, the city was looted by the Seljuk Sultan Sanjar and later became an important center of the Ismaili sect. After their defeat, the city flourished again, but was destroyed by Timur Gurkhani. The historical monuments of this region date back to the 7th and 8th centuries AH.[6] Historical legends[edit] Kashmar is a city with ancient history and many legendary stories Among the historical legends are about the Cypress of Kashmar.[7] The role of cypress on Tabriz carpet. The role of cypress on the lithographs of Persepolis. Cypress of Kashmar[edit] Main article: Cypress of Kashmar The Cypress of Kashmar is a mythical cypress tree of legendary beauty and gargantuan dimensions. It is said to have sprung from a branch brought by Zoroaster from Paradise and to have stood in today's Kashmar in northeastern Iran and to have been planted by Zoroaster in honor of the conversion of King Vishtaspa to Zoroastrianism. According to the Iranian physicist and historian Zakariya al-Qazwini King Vishtaspa had been a patron of Zoroaster who planted the tree himself. In his ʿAjā'ib al-makhlūqāt wa gharā'ib al-mawjūdāt, he further describes how the Al-Mutawakkil in 247 AH (861 AD) caused the mighty cypress to be felled, and then transported it across Iran, to be used for beams in his new palace at Samarra. Before, he wanted the tree to be reconstructed before his eyes. This was done in spite of protests by the Iranians, who offered a very high sum of money to save the tree. Al-Mutawakkil never saw the cypress, because he was murdered by a Turkish soldier (possibly in the employ of his son) on the night when it arrived on the banks of the Tigris.[8][9] Fire Temple of Kashmar[edit] Main article: Fire Temple of Kashmar Kashmar Fire Temple was the first Zoroastrian fire temple built by Vishtaspa at the request of Zoroaster in Kashmar. In a part of Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, the story of finding Zarathustra and accepting Vishtaspa's religion is regulated that after accepting Zoroastrian religion, Vishtaspa sends priests all over the universe And Azar enters the fire temples (domes) and the first of them is Adur Burzen-Mihr who founded in Kashmar and planted a cypress tree in front of the fire temple and made it a symbol of accepting the Bahi religion And he sent priests all over the world, and commanded all the famous men and women to come to that place of worship.[10] Religion[edit] The city is fourth pilgrimage city in Iran and it is the second most pilgrimage city after Mashhad in Razavi Khorasan Province.[11] Kashmar Higher Education Center Education[edit] At present, Kashmar has five higher education centers, including Payame Noor University of Kashmar, Islamic Azad University of Kashmar, Jihad University of Kashmar, Kashmar Higher Education Center and the School of Nursing. According to the statistics of the above institute, 3,794,420 students are studying in the country's universities, of which about 3,500 are Kashmir students.[12] A variety of raisins from different grapes Souvenirs[edit] The city is a major producer of raisins and has about 40 types of grapes.

However, between 1260 and 1280, mass production of carpets was recorded by historians.
