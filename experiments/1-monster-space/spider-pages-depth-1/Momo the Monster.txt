This article is about Cryptid from Missouri mythology. For other uses, see Momo (disambiguation). Momo the Monster, also known as the Missouri Monster (Momo), is a purported ape-like creature, similar to descriptions of Bigfoot, that was allegedly sighted by numerous people in rural Louisiana, Missouri in 1972. Unlike some other areas with similar reports of cryptids such as the Fouke Monster in Fouke, Arkansas or the Moth Man in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, Momo did not become a major tourist or economic folklore attraction.[1] Contents 1 Description 2 History 3 See also 4 References 5 Bibliography Description[edit] Alleged witnesses describe the creature as a large, bipedal humanoid, about 7 ft (2.1 m) tall, covered in dark hair that emits a putrid odor.[2] History[edit] The most well known alleged sighting occurred on July 11, 1972, when two young boys were playing the backyard on the rural outskirts of Louisiana, Missouri. Their older sister, Doris, was in the kitchen when she heard her brother's screaming. When she looked out of the window, she observed a massive, dark haired, man-like creature holding what appeared to be a deceased dog. She described it as having a "pumpkin shaped head", and large glowing orange eyes.[3] Many alleged sightings occurred that year, most notably was local fire department chief and member of the city council, Richard Allan Murray, who reported driving along a creek bed when he saw a massive upright creature in his vehicle's headlights. As a result of these reported encounters, a 20 person posse was formed to hunt the creature but nothing was ever found.[4] In 2019, a docudrama horror film entitled Momo: The Missouri Monster, was released and features a dramatization of the events of 1972. The film's cast includes Cliff Barackman and James "Bobo" Fay, best known for their appearances as Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO) members on the Animal Planet series, Finding Bigfoot.[5] American theme park Six Flags St. Louis had a ride that operated from 1972 until 1994 named for the creature.[6] See also[edit] Bigfoot Skunk ape Fouke Monster Honey Island Swamp monster References[edit] ^ Banias, MJ (30 September 2019).
