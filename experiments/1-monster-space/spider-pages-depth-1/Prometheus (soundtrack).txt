The score was recorded over one week with a 90-piece orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, England,[5] where it was also processed by Scott after the fact.[6] Streitenfeld began coming up with ideas for the score after reading the script prior to the commencement of filming. To create an "unsettling" sound, he provided the orchestra with reversed music sheets to have them play segments of the score backwards, before then digitally reversing it.[5] The track "Friend from the Past" reprises Jerry Goldsmith's original main title from the Alien soundtrack.
