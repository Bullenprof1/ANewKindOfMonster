Persian poetic work by Rumi This article is about the Sufi poem by Rumi. For the type of poem, see Masnavi (poetic form). Masnavi, a calligraphic specimen from 1490, Mevlana Museum, Konya, Turkey. The Masnavi, or Masnavi-ye-Ma'navi (Persian: مثنوی معنوی‎), also written Mathnawi, or Mathnavi, is an extensive poem written in Persian by Jalal al-Din Muhammad Balkhi, also known as Rumi. The Masnavi is one of the most influential works of Sufism, commonly called "the Quran in Persian".[1] It has been viewed by many commentators as the greatest mystical poem in world literature.[2] The Masnavi is a series of six books of poetry that together amount to around 25,000 verses or 50,000 lines.[3][4] It is a spiritual text that teaches Sufis how to reach their goal of being truly in love with God.[5] Contents 1 General description 2 Creation 3 Themes and narrative devices 4 English versions 4.1 Direct translations from Persian 4.2 Paraphrases of English translations 5 Urdu and Persian interpretations 6 See also 7 References 8 Further reading 9 External links General description[edit] A Persian miniature depicting Jalal al-Din Rumi showing love for his disciple Hussam al-Din Chelebi (c. 1594) The title Masnavi-ye-Ma'navi (Persian: مثنوی معنوی‎) means "The Spiritual Couplets". The Masnavi is a poetic collection of anecdotes and stories derived from the Quran, hadith [6] sources, and everyday tales. Stories are told to illustrate a point and each moral is discussed in detail. It incorporates a variety of Islamic wisdom but primarily focuses on emphasizing inward personal Sufi interpretation. In contrast to Rumi's Diwan, the Masnavi is a relatively "sober" text. It explains the various dimensions of spiritual life and practice to Sufi disciples and anyone who wishes to ponder the meaning of life.[7] Creation[edit] The Masnavi was started by the Rumi during the final years of his life. He began dictating the first book around the age of 54 around the year 1258 and continued composing verses until his death in 1273. The sixth and final book would remain incomplete.[8] It is documented that Rumi began dictating the verses of the Masnavi at the request of his favourite disciple, Husam al-Din Chalabi, who observed that many of Rumi's followers dutifully read the works of Sana'i and 'Attar. Thus, Rumi began creating a work in the didactic style of Sana'i and 'Attar to complement his other poetry. These men are said to have met regularly in meetings where Rumi would deliver the verses and Chalabi would write them down and recite them back to him.[9] Each book consists of about 4,000 verses and contains its own prose introduction and prologue. The inconclusive ending of the sixth volume has given rise to suggestions that the work was not complete at the time of Rumi's death and claims about existence of another volume.[10] Themes and narrative devices[edit] The six books of the Masnavi can be divided into three groups of two because each pair is linked by a common theme:[11] Books 1 and 2: They "are principally concerned with the nafs, the lower carnal self, and its self-deception and evil tendencies." Books 3 and 4: These books share the principal themes of Reason and Knowledge. These two themes are personified by Rumi in the Biblical and Quranic figure of the Prophet Moses. Books 5 and 6: These last two books are joined by the universal ideal that man must deny his physical earthly existence to understand God's existence. In addition to the recurring themes presented in each book, Rumi includes multiple points of view or voices inviting the reader to fall into "imaginative enchantment." There are seven principal voices that Rumi uses in his writing:[12] The Authorial Voice – Conveys the authority of a Sufi teacher and generally appears in verses addressed to You, God, or you, of all humankind. The Story-telling Voice – May be interrupted by side stories that help clarify a statement, sometime taking hundreds of lines to make a point. The Analogical Voice – Interruptions to the flow of narration in order to explain a statement by use of analogy. The Voice of Speech and Dialogue of Characters – Many of the stories are told through dialogue between characters. The Moral Reflection – Supported by quotations from the Quran and hadith The Spiritual Discourse – Similar to analogical and model reflections. Hiatus – Rumi occasionally questions his own verses and writes that he cannot say more because the reader would not be capable of understanding. The Masnavi has no framed plot and includes a variety of scenes, from popular stories and scenes of the local bazaar to fables and tales from Rumi's time. It also includes quotations from the Qur'an and from hadith, accounts from the time of Mohammed. Although there is no constant frame, style, or plot, Rumi generally follows a certain writing pattern that flows in the following order:[13] P r o b l e m / T h e m e ⟶ C o m p l i c a t i o n ⟶ R e s o l u t i o n {\displaystyle \mathrm {Problem/Theme\longrightarrow Complication\longrightarrow Resolution} } English versions[edit] Direct translations from Persian[edit] Mathnawi Rumi, translation with commentary by M.
