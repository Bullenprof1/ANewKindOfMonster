He is of Welsh parentage.[4] He attended Higham Lane School followed by college at North Warwickshire College (now NWSLC) under the AV department with lecturers like Graham Bird. Since childhood, he wanted to direct his own films, stating that "Star Wars is definitely the reason that I wanted to become a filmmaker".[5] Edwards studied film and video at the Surrey Institute of Art & Design in Farnham, graduating in 1996.[citation needed] In 2012, he received an honorary Master of Arts from UCA. Edwards got his start in visual effects, creating digital effects for prestigious shows such as Nova, Perfect Disaster and Heroes and Villains, the latter of which a series for which he made 250 visual effects which won international recognition.[citation needed] In 2008 he entered the Sci-Fi-London 48-hour film challenge, where a movie had to be created start-to-finish in just two days, within certain criteria. Edwards won the contest and went on to write and direct Monsters, his first feature. Edwards personally created the visual effects for Monsters using off-the-shelf equipment. Besides the two main actors, the crew consisted of just five people.[6] The success of Monsters brought enough awareness in Hollywood to land Edwards a few major projects. After the film's release, he did interviews in Hollywood with several studios, including Legendary Pictures.[7] In January 2011, Edwards landed his first major Hollywood feature, as the director of the 2014 Godzilla reboot from Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures.[8] Edwards directed Rogue One, the first Star Wars stand-alone film, written by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy, based on a story by John Knoll and Gary Whitta, starring Felicity Jones, and released on 16 December 2016.[9][10] Three of his influences for filmmaking are George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Quentin Tarantino.[11] In May 2016, Edwards exited Godzilla: King of the Monsters in an amicable split with the studio to work on smaller scale projects.[12] In February 2020, it was reported that Edwards was set to direct and write an untitled science fiction project for New Regency along with Rogue One co-producer Kiri Hart serving as producer for the project.[13] Filmography[edit] Films[edit] As director[edit] Year Title Additional roles Notes 2008 Factory Farmed Screenwriter, cinematographer and editor Short film 2010 Monsters Screenwriter, director of photography, visual effects and production designer Directorial debut 2014 Godzilla 2016 Rogue One: A Star Wars Story Cameo role: "Rebel Soldier" Other credits[edit] Year Title Role Notes 2007 In the Shadow of the Moon Digital rostrum Documentary film 2014 Monsters: Dark Continent Executive producer 2017 Star Wars: The Last Jedi Cameo role: "Resistance Trench Soldier" Television[edit] As director[edit] Year Title Additional roles Notes 2005 End Day Screenwriter Television fillm 2006 Perfect Disaster Visual effects Documentary series (2 episodes) 2008 Heroes and Villains Documentary series (episode: "Attila the Hun") Other credits[edit] Year Title Role Notes 2002-2003 Nova Animator Documentary series (2 episodes) 2003 Seven Wonders of the Industrial World Visual effects Documentary series (7 episodes) 2004 Dive to Bermuda Triangle Digital effects Documentary television film 2005 Hiroshima Digital artist Documentary television film Space Race Digital effects designer / Digital effects artist Documentary series (2 episodes) UFO's: The Secret Evidence Visual effects Documentary television film TBA Monsters Consulting producer Future series References[edit] ^ Clarke, Cath (23 September 2010).
