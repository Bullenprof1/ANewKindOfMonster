But people should understand that Arrow weren't personally responsible for those masters. They sub-licensed those titles from the rightsholders and it was either put them out with the masters they'd been supplied with or not release them at all. It's an unfortunate position that a lot of independent labels find themselves in."[2] In 2015, Daniel Graham left Arrow to head distribution at CinemaLive.[3] Divisions[edit] Arrow Films[edit] Arrow Films is one of the U.K.'s leading independent distributors of world cinema, art house, horror and classic films. On 4 December 2009, Arrow Films released Departures in the United Kingdom theatrically; it won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2009 Oscars. Arrow Video[edit] Arrow Video is a specialist label that encapsulates the spirit of the video nasties of the 1980s, including retro-style artwork and posters. This label includes films by renowned horror directors George A. Romero, Lucio Fulci, Lamberto Bava and Dario Argento. Each title is released completely uncut, usually with new transfers, and with a choice between the original audio track and usually a lossless 5.1. Brand-new, specially commissioned artwork alongside the original release artwork are included on each release. Newly made and exclusive booklets are often accompanied with the Blu-ray/DVD. Also included are new extra features for each Blu-ray/DVD, with new interviews and documentaries. In August 2011, the Sony/PIAS warehouse fire in Enfield, North London during the 2011 England riots affected the release schedule and led to a substantial loss of stock. ArrowDrome[edit] In September 2011, Arrow Films launched a new sublabel, ArrowDrome, which includes new releases and several titles from the Arrow Video label being re-released. These new editions include reversible DVD sleeves, collectable booklets and extra features. The aim of ArrowDrome is to release DVD titles only at budget prices.[4] The collection includes these categories: ArrowDrome Action ArrowDrome Erotic ArrowDrome Giallo ArrowDrome Horror ArrowDrome Mystery ArrowDrome Samurai ArrowDrome Sci-fi ArrowDrome Blaxploitation Arrow Video USA[edit] In 2014, Arrow Films launched a successful Indiegogo campaign to begin releasing Blu-ray Discs and DVDs in North America. It was intended to begin with Blood and Black Lace, but rights holding issues shelved this release until July 2016. Arrow Video USA launched with the release of Mark of the Devil on 17 March 2014. They have, as of November 2016, released over 90 films collected across 70 releases, including several films that have never seen a Blu-ray Disc release. There have been a few exclusive North American Blu-ray Disc releases.[5] Arrow began releasing films in the North American market in 2015.[6] Francesco Simeoni, Arrow's head of production and acquisition stated that Arrow's desire to move into the North American market as "indicative of the transforming landscape of physical home entertainment distribution", noting that it was "not dying; itâ€™s evolving."[6] Reception[edit] Arrow has been listed by The Guardian twice as their home video distributor of the year.[7][8] In 2011, they listed Arrow as the Label of the Year noting their release of Bicycle Thieves, Rififi and Les Diaboliques and specifically praising their releases of horror films, where they "truly excel".[7] The second time was in 2013 when they awarded Arrow Films "Label of the Year", noting their releases of Lifeforce and releases of television shows such as Borgen and The Killing as highlights.[8] Camera Obscura: The Walerian Borowczyk Collection was voted the best home video release of 2014 by several publications, including Sight and Sound[9] and Little White Lies,[10] and won the Focal International Award for Best Archival Restoration Project[11] and the Cinema Ritrovato Award for Best DVD Series/Best Box.[12] References[edit] ^ "About Us | Arrow Films". arrowfilms.com.
