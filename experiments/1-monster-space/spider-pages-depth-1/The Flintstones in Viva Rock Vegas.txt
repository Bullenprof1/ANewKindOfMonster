It is set before the events of both the series and the first film, showing how Fred and Barney met Wilma and Betty. This film is also referenced from the Elvis Presley's song, Viva Las Vegas, as well as the MGM's 1964 film of the same name (which also the same company who formerly produced Tom and Jerry, created also by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera (which also starred in a special cameo appearances at the end of this film)), although they parodied under the word-play title, Viva Rock Vegas instead of Viva Las Vegas since it is set in stone-age. None of the original cast from the first film reprise their roles here. The film stars Mark Addy, replacing John Goodman as Fred Flintstone; Stephen Baldwin replacing Rick Moranis as Barney Rubble; Kristen Johnston replacing Elizabeth Perkins as Wilma Slaghoople; and Jane Krakowski replacing Rosie O'Donnell as Betty O'Shale. The supporting cast featured Joan Collins, Thomas Gibson, Harvey Korman (In his final film performance), and Alan Cumming in a dual role as The Great Gazoo and Mick Jagged, a parody of Mick Jagger. The film was a box office bomb, grossing only $59.5 million against its $83 million budget.[2] Like its predecessor, Viva Rock Vegas also received negative reviews, though some critics considered it an improvement over the first film.

Soon to be employed, now they want dates, and a little green alien The Great Gazoo, exiled to Earth by his species, offers to help, although only they can see him. Meanwhile, Wilma Slaghoople wants a normal life and activities, like bowling, though her controlling mother Pearl wants her to marry smooth casino-owner Chip Rockefeller. After Wilma angrily runs away to Bronto King in Bedrock, waitress Betty O'Shale, mistaking her as "caveless", offers to share her apartment and gets her a job. Smitten with the waitresses, the two men invite them to a carnival, with Fred dating Betty and Barney taking Wilma. However, the couples do not really feel a connection until both men switch dates. Fred wins a carnival game and gets a prize of an egg which hatches into a baby dinosaur, which he names "Dino". Wilma invites her new friends home to a birthday party for her father, Colonel Slaghoople, where all are shocked by her wealth. Fred intends to propose but changes his mind after meeting Chip, who berates him for his low-level job at Slate & Company. Pearl dislikes the three new friends, but the Colonel, glad for Wilma's happiness, accepts them and privately gives Wilma a valuable pearl necklace that once belonged to his great-grandmother. After the boys disgrace themselves at dinner, Wilma nevertheless proclaims her pride and follows them out. Chip congratulates Fred on attracting Wilma and apologizes for mocking Fred's job. He invites the group to his Rock Vegas resort as a peace offering. However, unbeknownst to the group, Chip plots to hope Fred gambles so Wilma dumps him, whereas Fred sees it as a chance to win big so he can impress Wilma with money like Chip's. Chip and his girlfriend Roxie are visited by gangsters Big Rocko and Little Rocko to collect a lot of money that Chip owes their boss. Gazoo overhears Chip claiming his upcoming marriage to Wilma will grant him access to the Slaghoople fortune. Big Rocko and Little Rocko consider that plan creditable, so they agree to suspend collections until after the wedding. When Barney tries to keep Fred from high-stakes poker, Chip sends Roxie to seduce Barney for an escort to an all-you-can-eat buffet. Chip keeps Fred gambling to miss his dinner date with the others. Betty sees Barney wipe cream from Roxie's chest and misinterprets the move as a pass. Mick Jagged comforts the weeping girl, and they go on a date. Wilma breaks up with Fred over not spending any time with her. Chip warns her of burglaries and arranges that Fred loses everything before slipping Wilma's pearls in Fred's pocket and asking him to empty them. Hotel security arrests Fred for robbery, but when Barney protests that Fred is incapable of robbery, and that Fred would not even be able to crack his own knuckles without help, Chip accuses Barney of being Fred's accomplice and has him arrested, as well. Angered that the two stole from her, Wilma goes back to Chip. In prison, the men are visited by Gazoo who reveals that Chip is in severe debt to the mob and hopes to solve both his problems by framing Fred for the robbery and marrying Wilma to get the Slaghooples' money. Barney slips through the bars, steals the keys, and unlocks the cell. Disguised in drag as dancers, they accidentally run into Jagged's dressing room. Barney tells Betty he loves her, and they reconcile after the misunderstanding involving Roxie at the buffet is cleared up, and Barney knocks out Jagged. Fred plans to disguise himself as Jagged in an attempt to reconcile with Wilma. Meanwhile, in the audience, Chip proposes to an unresponsive Wilma. Fred then comes on stage disguised as Jagged and briefly sings to Wilma. He apologizes for his behavior earlier before proposing to her. Knowing that she still loves Fred, Wilma happily accepts, rejecting Chip, and they marry in the Rock Vegas Chapel of Love. Chip sees Big Rocko and Little Rocko starting to dismantle a Chip doll. After the pastor proclaims them husband and wife, everyone sings "Meet the Flintstones". When Jagged sings "Viva Rock Vegas" at a party, Betty catches Wilma's tossed bouquet and kisses Barney. The newlyweds drive away with Dino and Gazoo to goodbye waves from their friends, family, and even a handcuffed Chip and Roxie. Cast[edit] Mark Addy as Fred Flintstone, a crane operator.

Stephenson, who played both the Showroom announcer and the Minister, provided the voice of Mr. Slate from the animated series.
