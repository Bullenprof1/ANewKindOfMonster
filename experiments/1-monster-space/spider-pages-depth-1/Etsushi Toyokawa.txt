He began by joining the sho-gekijo theatrical troupe "Under Thirty," which was known for the membership of another famous actor, Watanabe Eriko, at the time. Though like many new theatre actors at the time, he struggled to make ends meet until he got his first big break in 1992, in the television drama Night Head alongside Shinji Takeda, as one of two brothers with supernatural powers.[citation needed] In 1993 he won the "Newcomer of the Year" award for his drama Kira Kira Hikaru, and the Popularity Award in 1996 for his work in the drama Love Letter.[citation needed] He also won the Japanese Academy Award as best supporting actor three times, the Hochi Film Award for Love Letter, No Way Back and Hanako.[1] Selected filmography[edit] Film[edit] Year Film Role Notes Ref 1989 Kimi wa Boku ni Suki ni Naru 1990 Boiling Point Okinawa-Rengou Kumichou Byouin e Ikou 1991 12 Nin no Yasashii Nihonjin 1992 Kira Kira Hikaru Mutsuki Kishida 1993 Tsuribaka Nisshi 6 1994 Undo Yukio Night Head Naoto Kirihara Leading role Ghost Pub Nobuya Sugimoto 1995 Love Letter Shigeru Akiba No Way Back Yuji Kobayashi American film School Mystery Yuji Sakamoto Also known as Phantom of the Toilet 1996 Yatsuhaka-Mura Kosuke Kindaichi Leading role 1997 Kizu Darake no Tenshi Mitsuru Kida Leading role 2000 Face Hiroyuki Nakagami Zawazawa Shimokitazawa New Battles Without Honor and Humanity Kadoya Kaneo 2002 Inochi Yutaka Higashi Dog Star Shiro 2003 Moon Child vampire Luca 2004 Tange Sazen Tange Sazen Leading role Lakeside Murder Case Masaru Tsukumi 2005 The Man Behind the Scissors Yasunaga Year One in the North Ashirika The Great Yokai War Yasunori Katō Loft Makoto Yoshioka 2006 Hula Girls Yojiro Tanikawa Nihon Chinbotsu Yusuke Tadokoro 2007 Tsubaki Sanjuro Hanbei Muroto Remake of the Kurosawa film The Kiss Akio Sakaguchi Southbound Ichiro Uehara Leading role The Investigation Game Fumihiko Makishima Leading role 2008 10 Promises to My Dog Yuichi Saito Teacher and Three Children Yoshihito Yamazaki 20th Century Boys Otcho 2009 20th Century Boys 2: The Last Hope Otcho 20th Century Boys 3: Redemption Otcho 2010 Sword of Desperation Kanemi Sanzaemon Leading role A Good Husband Shunsuke Kitami Leading role Postcard Keita Matsuyama Leading role 2013 Platinum Data Reiji Asama Human Trust Harry Endo 2014 Judge!
