However, the planes on the ride were removed in 1975. The giant ape that resembles King Kong fell apart when they tried to move it to New York for refurbishment in 1980.[2] Three decades later, 6,200 people took a survey and voted to bring back Kong in order to revitalize Wildwood's famous boardwalk. They got their wish and the new Kong ride opened in 2015. Underneath the current Kong ride is a store that has Wildwood and Kong merchandise.[3][4][5][6] Theme[edit] The theme of the ride is set to the classic 1933 movie King Kong, where the airplanes fly around the buildings trying to take down the reckless ape.
