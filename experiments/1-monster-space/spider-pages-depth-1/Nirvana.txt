Hence the original meaning of the word is "blown out, extinguished". (Sandhi changes the sounds: the v of vāna causes nis to become nir, and then the r of nir causes retroflexion of the following n: nis+vāna > nirvāṇa).[19] However the Buddhist meaning of nirvana also has other interpretations. L. S. Cousins said that in popular usage nirvana was "the goal of Buddhist discipline,... the final removal of the disturbing mental elements which obstruct a peaceful and clear state of mind, together with a state of awakening from the mental sleep which they induce."[20] Overview[edit] Nirvāṇa is a term found in the texts of all major Indian religions – Hinduism,[21] Jainism[22] Buddhism,[23] and Sikhism.[24][25] It refers to the profound peace of mind that is acquired with moksha, liberation from samsara, or release from a state of suffering, after respective spiritual practice or sādhanā.[note 2] The liberation from Saṃsāra developed as an ultimate goal and soteriological value in the Indian culture, and called by different terms such as nirvana, moksha, mukti and kaivalya. This basic scheme underlies Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism, where "the ultimate aim is the timeless state of moksa, or, as the Buddhists first seem to have called it, nirvana."[29] Although the term occurs in the literatures of a number of ancient Indian traditions, the concept is most commonly associated with Buddhism.[web 1] Some writers believe the concept was adopted by other Indian religions after it became established in Buddhism, but with different meanings and description, for instance the use of (Moksha) in the Hindu text Bhagavad Gita of the Mahabharata.[21] The idea of moksha is connected to the Vedic culture, where it conveyed a notion of amrtam, "immortality",[30][31] and also a notion of a timeless, "unborn", or "the still point of the turning world of time". It was also its timeless structure, the whole underlying "the spokes of the invariable but incessant wheel of time".[note 3] The hope for life after death started with notions of going to the worlds of the Fathers or Ancestors and/or the world of the Gods or Heaven.[30][note 4] The earliest Vedic texts incorporate the concept of life, followed by an afterlife in heaven and hell based on cumulative virtues (merit) or vices (demerit).[32] However, the ancient Vedic Rishis challenged this idea of afterlife as simplistic, because people do not live an equally moral or immoral life. Between generally virtuous lives, some are more virtuous; while evil too has degrees, and either permanent heaven or permanent hell is disproportionate. The Vedic thinkers introduced the idea of an afterlife in heaven or hell in proportion to one's merit, and when this runs out, one returns and is reborn.[33][34][35] The idea of rebirth following "running out of merit" appears in Buddhist texts as well.[36] This idea appears in many ancient and medieval texts, as Saṃsāra, or the endless cycle of life, death, rebirth and redeath, such as section 6:31 of the Mahabharata[37] and verse 9.21 of the Bhagavad Gita.[38][39][note 5] The Saṃsara, the life after death, and what impacts rebirth came to be seen as dependent on karma.[42] Buddhism[edit] Main article: Nirvana (Buddhism) Khmer traditional mural painting depicts Gautama Buddha entering nirvana, Dharma assembly pavilion, Wat Botum Wattey Reacheveraram, Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Nirvana (nibbana) literally means "blowing out" or "quenching".[43] It is the most used as well as the earliest term to describe the soteriological goal in Buddhism: release from the cycle of rebirth (saṃsāra).[44] Nirvana is part of the Third Truth on "cessation of dukkha" in the Four Noble Truths doctrine of Buddhism.[44] It is the goal of the Noble Eightfold Path.[45] The Buddha is believed in the Buddhist scholastic tradition to have realized two types of nirvana, one at enlightenment, and another at his death.[46] The first is called sopadhishesa-nirvana (nirvana with a remainder), the second parinirvana or anupadhishesa-nirvana (nirvana without remainder, or final nirvana).[46] In the Buddhist tradition, nirvana is described as the extinguishing of the fires that cause rebirths and associated suffering.[47] The Buddhist texts identify these three "three fires"[2] or "three poisons" as raga (greed, sensuality), dvesha (aversion, hate) and avidyā or moha (ignorance, delusion).[48][49] The state of nirvana is also described in Buddhism as cessation of all afflictions, cessation of all actions, cessation of rebirths and suffering that are a consequence of afflictions and actions.[44] Liberation is described as identical to anatta (anatman, non-self, lack of any self).[50][51] In Buddhism, liberation is achieved when all things and beings are understood to be with no Self.[51][52] Nirvana is also described as identical to achieving sunyata (emptiness), where there is no essence or fundamental nature in anything, and everything is empty.[53][54] In time, with the development of Buddhist doctrine, other interpretations were given, such as being an unconditioned state,[55] a fire going out for lack of fuel, abandoning weaving (vana) together of life after life,[19] and the elimination of desire.[56] However, Buddhist texts have asserted since ancient times that nirvana is more than "destruction of desire", it is "the object of the knowledge" of the Buddhist path.[57]k Hinduism[edit] The most ancient texts of Hinduism such as the Vedas and early Upanishads don't mention the soteriological term Nirvana.[21] This term is found in texts such as the Bhagavad Gita[21] and the Nirvana Upanishad, likely composed in the post-Buddha era.[58] The concept of Nirvana is described differently in Buddhist and Hindu literature.[59] Hinduism has the concept of Atman – the soul, self[60][61][62] – asserted to exist in every living being, while Buddhism asserts through its anatman doctrine that there is no Atman in any being.[63][64] Nirvana in Buddhism is "stilling mind, cessation of desires, and action" unto emptiness, states Jeaneane Fowler, while nirvana in post-Buddhist Hindu texts is also "stilling mind but not inaction" and "not emptiness", rather it is the knowledge of true Self (Atman) and the acceptance of its universality and unity with metaphysical Brahman.[59] Moksha[edit] Main article: Moksha The ancient soteriological concept in Hinduism is moksha, described as the liberation from the cycle of birth and death through self-knowledge and the eternal connection of Atman (soul, self) and metaphysical Brahman. Moksha is derived from the root muc* (Sanskrit: मुच्) which means free, let go, release, liberate; Moksha means "liberation, freedom, emancipation of the soul".[65][66] In the Vedas and early Upanishads, the word mucyate (Sanskrit: मुच्यते)[65] appears, which means to be set free or release - such as of a horse from its harness. The traditions within Hinduism state that there are multiple paths (Sanskrit: marga) to moksha: jnana-marga, the path of knowledge; bhakti-marga, the path of devotion; and karma-marga, the path of action.[67] Brahma-nirvana in the Bhagavad Gita[edit] The term Brahma-nirvana appears in verses 2.72 and 5.24-26 of the Bhagavad Gita.[68] It is the state of release or liberation; the union with the Brahman.[7] According to Easwaran, it is an experience of blissful egolessness.[69] According to Zaehner, Johnson and other scholars, nirvana in the Gita is a Buddhist term adopted by the Hindus.[21] Zaehner states it was used in Hindu texts for the first time in the Bhagavad Gita, and that the idea therein in verse 2.71-72 to "suppress one's desires and ego" is also Buddhist.[21] According to Johnson the term nirvana is borrowed from the Buddhists to confuse the Buddhists, by linking the Buddhist nirvana state to the pre-Buddhist Vedic tradition of metaphysical absolute called Brahman.[21] According to Mahatma Gandhi, the Hindu and Buddhist understanding of nirvana are different because the nirvana of the Buddhists is shunyata, emptiness, but the nirvana of the Gita means peace and that is why it is described as brahma-nirvana (oneness with Brahman).[70] Jainism[edit] Main article: Moksha (Jainism) Kalpasutra folio on Mahavira Nirvana. Note the crescent shaped Siddhashila, a place where all siddhas reside after nirvana. The terms moksa and nirvana are often used interchangeably in the Jain texts.[71][72] Rishabhanatha, believed to have lived over a million years ago, was the first Tirthankara to attain nirvana. Uttaradhyana Sutra provides an account of Sudharman – also called Gautama, and one of the disciples of Mahavira – explaining the meaning of nirvana to Kesi, a disciple of Parshva.[73][note 6] There is a safe place in view of all, but difficult of approach, where there is no old age nor death, no pain nor disease. It is what is called nirvāṇa, or freedom from pain, or perfection, which is in view of all; it is the safe, happy, and quiet place which the great sages reach. That is the eternal place, in view of all, but difficult of approach. Those sages who reach it are free from sorrows, they have put an end to the stream of existence. (81-4) – Translated by Hermann Jacobi, 1895 Sikhism[edit] The concept of liberation as "extinction of suffering", along with the idea of sansara as the "cycle of rebirth" is also part of Sikhism.[74] Nirvana appears in Sikh texts as the term Nirban.[75][76] However, the more common term is Mukti or Moksh,[77] a salvation concept wherein loving devotion to God is emphasized for liberation from endless cycle of rebirths.[76] In other religions[edit] Manichaenism[edit] The term Nirvana (also mentioned is parinirvana) in the thirteenth or fourtheenth century Manichaean work "The great song to Mani" and "The story of the Death of Mani", referring to the realm of light.[78] See also[edit] Ataraxia Baqaa Bodhi Dzogchen Enlightenment (spiritual) God in Buddhism Jannah (Islam) Jnana Monastic silence Nirguna Nirvana fallacy Satori Salvation Shangri-La Śūnyatā Yoga Zen Notes[edit] ^ Also called vimoksha, vimukti. The Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism: "Vimoksha [解脱] (Skt; Jpn gedatsu). Emancipation, release, or liberation. The Sanskrit words vimukti, mukti, and moksha also have the same meaning. Vimoksha means release from the bonds of earthly desires, delusion, suffering and transmigration. While Buddhism sets forth various kinds and stages of emancipation, or enlightenment, the supreme emancipation is nirvana,[6][web 2] ^ It is sometimes referred to as bhavana, which refers to spiritual "development" or "cultivating" or "producing"[26][27] in the sense of "calling into existence",[28] ^ The wheel is a typical Vedic, or Indo-European, symbol, which is manifested in various symbols of the Vedic religion and of Buddhism and Hinduism. See, for examples, Dharmacakra, Chakra, Chakravartin, Kalachakra, Dukkha and Mandala. ^ See also Heaven (Christianity) and Walhalla ^ Many texts discuss this theory of rebirth with the concepts of Devayana (path of gods) and Pitryana (path of fathers).[40][41] ^ The authenticity of this text is in doubt because Parshva, in Jain tradition, lived about 250 years before Mahavira, and his disciple Kesi would have been a few hundred years old when he met the disciple of Mahavira.

One's true identity lies in realizing that the Atman in me and the Brahman - the ground of all existence - are similar. [...] The closest kin of Atman is the Atman of all living things, which is grounded in the Brahman. When the Atman strives to be like Brahman it is only because it realizes that that is its origin - God. [...] Separation between the Atman and the Brahman is proved to be impermanent. What is ultimately permanent is the union between the Atman and the Brahman. [...] Thus, life's struggle is for the Atman to be released from the body, which is impermanent, to unite with Brahman, which is permanent - this doctrine is known as Moksha. ^ Fowler 2012, p. 46: "Shankara interpreted the whole of the Gita as extolling the path of knowledge as the best means to moksha, and a total identity of the atman with Brahman..., sfn error: no target: CITEREFFowler2012 (help) ^ John E.

Buddhist Thought. Routledge. p. 61. ISBN 978-0-415-20701-0. He makes no mention of discovering the True Self in the Anattalakkhana Sutta. As we have seen, the Buddha explains how liberation comes from letting-go of all craving and attachment simply through seeing that things are not Self anatta. That is all there is to it. One cuts the force that leads to rebirth and suffering. There is no need to postulate a Self beyond all this. Indeed any postulated Self would lead to attachment, for it seems that for the Buddha a Self fitting the description could legitimately be a suitable subject of attachment. There is absolutely no suggestion that the Buddha thought there is some additional factor called the Self (or with any other name, but fitting the Self-description) beyond the five aggregates. ^ Mun-Keat Choong (1999).

The present study is concerned with this teaching of emptiness (P. sunnata, Skt. sunyata) as presented in the texts of early Buddhism. [...] The teaching of emptiness is recognized as the central philosophy of early Mahayana. However, this teaching exists in both early Buddhism and early Mahayana Buddhism, where it is connected with the meaning of conditioned genesis, the middle way, nirvana and not-self (P. anatta, Skt. anatman)., ^ Ray Billington (2002).

(...) everything is empty."; Quote (p 136): "What we can say, whichever branch of Buddhism we may have in mind, is that the state of nirvana, to which all Buddhists aspire, is like samadhi, a non-dual state. (...) the Buddhist concept of enlightened mind - bodhichitta - refers to a state beyond desire (dukkha) whereby the one who seeks nirvana has achieved shunyata, the emptiness or void described on pages 58-9." ^ John J.
