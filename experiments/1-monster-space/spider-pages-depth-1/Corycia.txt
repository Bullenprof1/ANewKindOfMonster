Her father was the local river-god Kephisos or Pleistos of northern Boeotia. With Apollo, she became the mother of Lycoreus (Lyrcorus) who gave his name to the city Lycoreia. Corycia was one of the nymphs of the springs of the Corycian Cave which was named after her. She was related to the nymph, Castalia, who presided over the sacred springs at Delphi. Corycia was closely identified with Kleodora and Melaina.[1] The plural, Coryciae, is applied to the daughters of Pleistos.[2] References[edit] ^ Pausanias.
