She and her sisters Melaina and Daphnis lived on Mount Parnassus, where Delphi is located. With Poseidon (or Kleopompos), she was the mother of Parnassos,[1] who created a method of telling the future using birds and founded the main city on Mt. Parnassus. Kleodora's father was Cephissus, a river-god of northern Boeotia. Kleodora's name means "Glorious Gift", in reference to her gift of prophecy. As a member of the Thriae, Kleodora is often conflated with the bee maidens of the Homeric Hymn to Hermes, whom Apollo directs Hermes to learn prophecy from.[2] Notes[edit] ^ Pausanias, Graeciae Descriptio 10.6.13 ^ Larson, Jennifer (1996).
