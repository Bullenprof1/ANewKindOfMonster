Contents 1 Significance 2 Attitude 3 Examples 4 Gallery 5 Notes Significance[edit] The emmet might be understood as a symbol of hard work and of wisdom, although symbolism in heraldry always has to be approached with skepticism, as the arms might be canting, or the symbolism might not apply in a particular case. In his A Display of Heraldrie (1610), John Guillim of the English College of Arms says: "By the Emmet or Pismire may be signified a Man of great Labour, Wisdom, and Providence in all his Affairs, and of a pregnant and ready Memory."[1] Attitude[edit] The emmet is often shown as tergiant, or with his back to the viewer, as seen from above. Examples[edit] Massy: argent a bend azure between three emmets sable[2] Emmitt: sable two cross bones saltierwise between four emmets or on a chief engrailed erminois two bulls' heads azure[3] Gallery[edit] Arms of Ahja, in Estonia Arms of Bjärtrå, in Sweden Arms of Brekendorf, in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany Arms of Fulleren, in Alsace, France Arms of the commune of Saint-Maurice-sur-Moselle, France Arms of Sewen, France Arms of Marwice, Poland Arms of Zeschdorf, in Brandenburg, Germany Notes[edit] Wikimedia Commons has media related to Ants in heraldry.
