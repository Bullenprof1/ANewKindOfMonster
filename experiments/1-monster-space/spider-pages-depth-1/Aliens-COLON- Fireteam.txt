The player assumes the role of a Colonial Marine on board the USS Endeavor, a spaceship tasked with responding to a distress call from the outer colonies.[1][2] Gameplay[edit] The game has five character classes: Gunner, Demolisher, Technician, Doc, and Recon. The game contains four story campaigns with three missions each, and the player is accompanied by two allies who can be controlled by another player or by an AI.[5] There are five levels of difficulty and twenty types of enemies, and weapon customization and character progression are present within the game.[6] Local co-op is not available, though online matchmaking can be public or private.[7] There are plans for post-launch DLC, but there are no loot boxes or microtransactions.[7][8] The gameplay seen in the reveal trailer and in a hands-off demo has been compared to the Left 4 Dead duology.[7][9][10] Release[edit] Cold Iron Studios was founded in 2015 by the team which had created games including City of Heroes and Star Trek Online. It was acquired by FoxNext Games in March 2019. FoxNext was a mobile game publisher, and intended to use Cold Iron's new Aliens game to expand its portfolio to include larger scale triple A projects.[11] FoxNext was later acquired by Disney, which sold off the studio to Scopely, which then subsequently sold Cold Iron to Daybreak Game Company.[12] The game is set to launch in mid 2021 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and Series S.[4][3] References[edit] ^ a b c Sheridan, Wade (2 March 2021).
