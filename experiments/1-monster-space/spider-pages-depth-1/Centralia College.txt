Developing slowly at first, the college constructed its first physical campus in 1950 with Kemp Hall.[4] Also, in 1948 the college received its accreditation from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities.[5] Growing from an entrance class of 15 students, as of 2009[update] the college has an enrollment of 4,803 students in 64 academic programs.[3] The college is affiliated with the private Centralia College Foundation, founded in 1982 by community members, to supplement its public resources. The college is also home to Michael Spafford's The Twelve Labors of Hercules, a series of murals commissioned in the early 1980s for the House of Representatives' chambers.[6] From 1982 to 1987 they were covered with curtains due to their perceived (by some) sexually suggestive nature and later were placed in storage. Following a decade of negotiations, the college acquired the murals in 2002 for display in the Corbet Theatre.[7][8] Murals created by Alden Mason and originally displayed at the Capitol were moved to the college library in 1990.[9][10] In 2012 the college began offering a Bachelor of Applied Science in Applied Management degree. It now offers a Bachelor of Applied Science in Diesel Technology degree and a Bachelor of Applied Science in Information Science and Application Development degree. Athletics[edit] The college's mascot is the Trailblazer and the athletics program includes teams for women's volleyball, men's baseball, men's and women's basketball, women's fast pitch softball and women's golf. These teams play in the Northwest Athletic Conference (NWAC).[11] References[edit] ^ a b "About Centralia College". Centralia College. 2008. Retrieved 2009-03-28.
