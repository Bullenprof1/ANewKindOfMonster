She was a Laconian princess as the daughter of King Eurotas and thus, sister to Sparta. By the river Tiasa was situated a temple of Cleta and Phaenna, the two Charites recognized in Sparta, which was purported to have been founded by Lacedaemon.[2] Notes[edit] ^ Cf. also Hesychius of Alexandria s. v. Τίασσα: "Tiassa: a spring in Lacedaemon; according to some a river". A "fountain of Tiassus" is also mentioned in Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae 4.139B ^ Pausanias, Graeciae Descriptio 3.18.6 References[edit] Athenaeus of Naucratis, The Deipnosophists or Banquet of the Learned.
