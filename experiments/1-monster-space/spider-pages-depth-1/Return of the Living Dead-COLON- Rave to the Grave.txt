He is greeted by a team of Interpol agents whose goal is to destroy the last of the canisters to avoid another incident. Nevertheless, one of them sprays three corpses with the gas, and revives them. Charles is killed during the incident, along with the mortuary owner and one of the government officials. It's Halloween, and Jenny with Julian, Cody and Becky, the last three survivors of the previous film, are now in college and they receive notice of the "murder" of Charles. Julian and Jenny go to search for and possibly sell what belonged to Charles, and they find the last two barrels of Trioxin. One of them is taken to Cody, who tests the chemical inside it. Jeremy, Jenny's brother, tastes the chemical when he thinks that it is a drug similar to ecstasy, but he goes into a spasm, in which he foams at the mouth, and later describes what it was like. The chemical is named "Z" for its zombie-like effect on the living. Cody, Jeremy and Shelby extract the chemical from the canister and they put the liquid extract into pills which they sell to Skeet, so he can sell the drug around the school. While Skeet informs everyone to only take one pill at a time for health reasons, most take more than one pill at a time which speeds up the process that causes humans to reanimate as zombies. Gino and Aldo Serra, the only survivors from the beginning of the movie, recognize what is going on when they are shown the severed head of one of the zombies, and they go to question Julian, knowing that he is familiar with Trioxin, but he does not tell them anything of the canisters that he and Jenny discovered. Sometime later, people are turning into zombies, and the drug is being passed around a rave and getting out of control, Cody And Shelby Are Killed. Jenny Kills Zombie Jeremy. Seeing no other option, Aldo calls in military assistance, but he is told that an American bomber plane is already on the way to the rave location. The plane launches a bomb which detonates in the center of the rave. Jenny And Julian Emerge From The Rubble Alive and Aldo asks where’s Gino and try’s to find him. It is unclear if Gino died during the blast Cast[edit] Jenny Mollen as Jenny Aimee-Lynn Chadwick as Becky Carlton Cory Hardrict as Cody John Keefe as Julian Garrison Peter Coyote as Uncle Charles Claudiu Bleonț as Aldo Serra Sorin Cocis as Gino Cain Mihnea Manoliu as Jeremy George Dumitrescu as Artie Maria Dinulescu as Shelby Catalin Paraschiv as Skeet Radu Romaniuc as Brett Sebastian Marina as Dartagnan Violeta Aldea as Rainbow Ricky Dandel as Coach Savini Allan Trautman as Tarman Production[edit] The film was shot immediately after Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis using locations and actors in Romania and Ukraine.
