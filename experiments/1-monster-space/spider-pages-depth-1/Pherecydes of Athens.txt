Pherecydes of Athens (fl. c. 465 BC),[1] described as an historian and genealogist, wrote an ancient work in ten books, now lost, variously titled "Historiai" (Ἱστορίαι) or "Genealogicai" (Γενελογίαι).[2] He is one of the authors (= FGrHist 3) whose fragments were collected in Felix Jacoby's Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker. He is generally thought to be different from the sixth-century Pre-Socratic philosopher Pherecydes of Syros, who was sometimes mentioned as one of the Seven Sages of Greece and was reputed to have been the teacher of Pythagoras.[3] Although the Suda considers them separately, he is possibly the same person as Pherecydes of Leros.[4] Notes[edit] ^ Fowler 2013, p. 708; Gantz, p. xv; Huxley 1973. ^ Huxley, p. 137; Jacoby, p. 15; Suda Φ 216.
