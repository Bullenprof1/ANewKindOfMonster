He used it to make eight. "The important thing was not to put Avco at risk for any major amount of money," he said. "We'd finance a movie and find a financial group to buy us out, so we could use the money over again."[7] Under his stewardship the company went from earning $20 million in 1978 to $90 million in 1981.[7] In June 1981, he joined Universal Pictures, becoming president of the Theatrical Motion Picture Group in December 1982.[6] He quit in December 1983.[8] In 1983, he became co-chairman and chief executive officer of New World Entertainment, Inc until 1989, when he and producer Mace Neufeld co-founded the motion picture production company Neufeld/Rehme Productions.[2] It was during this time that he created the pictures for which he is most known, such as Patriot Games and Flight of the Intruder.[2] Rehme served as a governor of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for eight years before becoming president in 1992, succeeding Karl Malden. Prior to that he had been President of the Academy Foundation. He could only serve as Academy President for one year as Academy rules stipulated that he could only sit on the board for nine consecutive terms.[9] He rejoined the board and became president for a second time from 1997 to 2001.[2] Select Credits[edit] He was a producer in all films unless otherwise noted.
