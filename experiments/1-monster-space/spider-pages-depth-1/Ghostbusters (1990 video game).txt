Middle ghosts include Slimer from the films, while boss enemies include the first film's Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.[10][13][11][6] The player must capture each boss enemy after its defeat.[6] The fifth level, set in a medieval castle, only becomes available upon completion of the other levels, and is followed by a final battle.[10][4][14] The game features 22 selectable musical scores, including Ray Parker Jr.'s song "Ghostbusters".[10] Reception[edit] Reception Review scores Publication Score ACE 815/1000[10] CVG 82%[13] The Games Machine 78%[7] Mean Machines 80%[11] Raze 72%[15] Sega-16 7/10[5] VideoGame [18] Mean Machines praised the introduction sequence, the graphics, and the variety of options, but stated that it "won't keep you occupied for months." The magazine concluded that the game was "fairly enjoyable" and that it would likely appeal most to people who enjoy platform games.[11] Julian Boardman of Raze liked the graphics, but criticized the gameplay as repetitive and average.[15] The Games Machine praised the playable character sprites for resembling their film counterparts, but criticized the simple and repetitive backgrounds. The magazine stated that it was one of the better platform games available for the Genesis, but that it "doesn't really capture the spirit of the film".[7] Robert Swan of Computer and Video Games praised the graphics, including the playable character sprites. He also praised the in-game music, but criticized the game's version of Parker's "Ghostbusters" song, considering it a "major let-down". Swan considered the game addictive despite its difficulty.[13] Eugene Lacey of ACE praised the design of the game's ghosts, but believed that Parker's song had been rendered better in other Ghostbusters games.[10] In 2004, Ken Horowitz of Sega-16 stated that it was one of the better movie-licensed games of its time, although he was disappointed by the minimum amount of visual effects, and stated that the opening theme music "has to be the worst rendition of Ray Parker Jr.'s classic that has ever been recorded and will quickly poison your enthusiasm." Horowitz stated that the game had good graphics upon its release, but that it "may not look all that appealing by today's standards".[5] In 2008, Levi Buchanan of IGN stated that the game was "pretty cool" upon its release, especially for Ghostbusters fans, but wrote that it was now "something of a mediocre side-scroller," stating that the graphics were still adequate but that the gameplay was "fairly tame compared to what would come later" on the Genesis. Buchanan also questioned the absence of the Ghostbuster character Winston Zeddemore.[6] In 2014, Robert Workman of Shacknews ranked it among the top three best Ghostbusters games. Although Workman believed that there were superior Sega platform games available at the time of its release, he stated that the game had an "innocuous charm to it".[16] In 2016, Luke McKinney of Den of Geek called the game "pretty decent" but ranked it among the weirdest Ghostbusters games, for its "macrocephalic" Ghostbuster characters and its absence of Winston.[19] References[edit] ^ [1] ^ [2] ^ [3] ^ a b c d Marriott, Scott Alan.
