Greek Goddess of Fortune For other uses, see API (disambiguation). Tyche Presiding tutelary deity governing the fortune and prosperity of a city, its destiny Polychrome marble statue depicting Tyche holding the infant Plutus in her arms, 2nd century AD, Istanbul Archaeological Museum Gender Female Personal information Parents Oceanus and Tethys, or Aphrodite and Zeus or Hermes Children Plutus Roman equivalent Fortuna Tyche (/ˈtaɪki/; Greek: Τύχη, Túkhē, 'Luck', Ancient Greek: [tý.kʰɛː], Modern Greek: [ˈti.çi]; Roman equivalent: Fortuna) was the presiding tutelary deity who governed the fortune and prosperity of a city, its destiny. In Classical Greek mythology, she is the daughter of Aphrodite and Zeus or Hermes. The Greek historian Polybius believed that when no cause can be discovered to events such as floods, droughts, frosts, or even in politics, then the cause of these events may be fairly attributed to Tyche.[1] Increasingly during the Hellenistic period, cities venerated their own Tychai, specific iconic versions of the original Tyche. This practice was continued in the iconography of Roman art, even into the Christian period, often as sets of the greatest cities of the empire.

She's sometimes named as the mother of Plutus,[4] the god of wealth; usually, however, he is the son of Demeter and Iasion.[5][6][7] Worship[edit] The remains of a Greek temple of Tyche, Olba Tyche was uniquely venerated at Itanos in Crete, as Tyche Protogeneia, linked with the Athenian Protogeneia ("firstborn"), daughter of Erechtheus, whose self-sacrifice saved the city.[8] In Alexandria the Tychaeon, the Greek temple of Tyche, was described by Libanius as one of the most magnificent of the entire Hellenistic world.[9] Stylianos Spyridacis [10] concisely expressed Tyche's appeal in a Hellenistic world of arbitrary violence and unmeaning reverses: "In the turbulent years of the Epigoni of Alexander, an awareness of the instability of human affairs led people to believe that Tyche, the blind mistress of Fortune, governed mankind with an inconstancy which explained the vicissitudes of the time."[11] Depictions[edit] Tyche on the reverse of this base metal coin by Gordian III (r. 238 – 244 AD) Tyche appears on many coins of the Hellenistic period in the three centuries before the Christian era, especially from cities in the Aegean. Unpredictable turns of fortune drive the complicated plotlines of Hellenistic romances, such as, Leucippe and Clitophon or Daphnis and Chloe. She experienced a resurgence in another era of uneasy change, the final days of publicly sanctioned Paganism, between the late-fourth-century emperors Julian and Theodosius I, who definitively closed the temples. The effectiveness of her capricious power even achieved respectability in philosophical circles during that generation, although among poets it was a commonplace to revile her for a fickle harlot.[12] In Greco-Roman and medieval art Tyche was depicted as wearing a mural crown, and carrying a cornucopia (horn of plenty), an emblematic gubernaculum (ship's rudder), and the wheel of fortune, or she may stand on the wheel, presiding over the entire circle of fate. The constellation of Virgo is sometimes identified as the heavenly figure of Tyche,[13] as well as other goddesses such as Demeter and Astraea. Greco-Roman Tychai[edit] The Three Tychai, c. 160 AD, Louvre Museum In late Roman sets the figures, usually four, represented the Tychai of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, and either Antioch (more usual, as in the Esquiline Treasure of about 380 AD) or Trier, as in the Calendar of 354. The Tychai may be seen wearing a mural crown (a crown like the walls of the city). Tyche of Rome Tyche from the Esquiline Treasure The Tyche of Rome was represented in military costume.[14] Tyche of Constantinople Base of a statue Tyche from the Esquiline Treasure The attributes of the Tyche of Constantinople included a cornucopia.[14] Tyche of Alexandria Tyche from the Esquiline Treasure The Tyche of Alexandria carried sheaves of corns and stepped on the bow of a ship.[14] Tyche of Antioch Provincial bronze coin of Trebonianus Gallus (reverse) Roman copy of a bronze by Eutychides, Galleria dei Candelabri, Vatican Museums Oval gem with Tyche of Antioch, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Tyche from the Esquiline Treasure Several artefacts feature the Tyche of Antioch with a male swimmer personifying the Orontes River at her feet.
