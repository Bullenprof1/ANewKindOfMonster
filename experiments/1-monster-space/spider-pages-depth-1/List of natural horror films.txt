Though killer animals in film have existed since the release of The Lost World in 1925,[2] two of the first motion pictures to garner mainstream success with a "nature run amok" premise were The Birds, directed by Alfred Hitchcock and released in 1963; and Jaws, directed by Steven Spielberg and released in 1975. Following Jaws, numerous horror films of a similar narrative were produced, including Grizzly (1976), Piranha (1978), and Alligator (1980).[3] Contents 1 Arachnids 2 Birds 3 Fish 3.1 Piranhas 3.2 Sharks 4 Insects 4.1 Ants 4.2 Honey bees 4.3 Cockroaches 4.4 Locusts 4.5 Wasps 5 Mammals 5.1 Bats 5.2 Bears 5.3 Canines 5.4 Felines 5.5 Primates 5.6 Rats 5.7 Whales 5.8 Others 6 Mollusks 6.1 Gastropods 6.2 Octopuses 7 Reptiles 7.1 Alligators and crocodiles 7.2 Dinosaurs 7.3 Snakes 8 Plants 9 Worms 10 Miscellaneous 11 See also 12 References Arachnids[edit] Kingdom of the Spiders (1977; tarantulas)[1] Arachnophobia (1990; spiders)[4] Ticks (1993; giant ticks)[5] Eight Legged Freaks (2002; giant spiders)[6] Big Ass Spider!
