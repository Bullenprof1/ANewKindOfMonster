(September 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Escutcheon showing Argent, a lozenge gules The lozenge in heraldry is a diamond-shaped charge (an object that can be placed on the field of the shield), usually somewhat narrower than it is tall. It is to be distinguished in modern heraldry from the fusil, which is like the lozenge but narrower, though the distinction has not always been as fine and is not always observed even today. A mascle is a voided lozenge—that is, a lozenge with a lozenge-shaped hole in the middle—and the rarer rustre is a lozenge containing a circular hole in the centre. A field covered in a pattern of lozenges is described as lozengy; similar fields of mascles are masculy, and fusils, fusily (see Variation of the field). In civic heraldry, a lozenge sable is often used in coal-mining communities to represent a lump of coal. A lozenge shaped escutcheon is used to depict heraldry for a female (in continental Europe especially an unmarried woman), but is also sometimes used as a shape for mural monuments in churches which commemorate females.[1] Funerary hatchments are generally shown within lozenge shaped frames, for both male and female deceased.

The arms granted to the Canadian John Francis Cappucci bring an example of lozengy voided, the same as "lozengy" but with a smaller lozenge-shaped hole cut out of each segment.[2] Examples[edit] This Monegasque flag is "lozengy argent and gules" A variant Flag of Bavaria, an array of 21 or more lozenges bendwise of blue and white (blazoned as a field "fusilly in bend" or sometimes "bendy lozengy").
