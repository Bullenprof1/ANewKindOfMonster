For two years, they completed orders left over from EMI's company, which helped keep and maintain a loyal customer base.[1] In 2008, Vinyl Factory expanded into a record label.[2] Commissions & exhibitions[edit] The Vinyl Factory has curated exhibitions and events at three spaces in London, The Vinyl Factory Soho, Brewer Street Car Park and Store Studios, 180 The Strand.

Previously, The Vinyl Factory has presented solo exhibitions by Ragnar Kjartansson, Ryoji Ikeda, Carsten Nicolai and Richard Mosse, and group exhibitions with Lazarides,[8] and The Moving Museum as well as celebrations of the vinyl aesthetic of Kraftwerk, David Bowie and Punk.

In 2017, The Vinyl Factory initiated VF Commissions, a new venture producing and collaborating with artists to create new site specific works.
