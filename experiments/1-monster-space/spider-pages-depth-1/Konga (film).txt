Konga is a 1961 British-American horror science fiction film directed by John Lemont and starring Michael Gough, Margo Johns and Austin Trevor. It was shot at Merton Park Studios and in Croydon for Anglo Amalgamated, then distributed in the United States by American International Pictures (AIP) as a double feature with Master of the World. Anglo Amalgamated and AIP each provided half the funding for the US$500,000 film, with each studio receiving distribution rights in their respective hemispheres.[1] Konga was the basis for a comic book series published by Charlton Comics and initially drawn by Steve Ditko (prior to Ditko's co-creation of Spider-Man) in the 1960s.[2] Contents 1 Plot 2 Cast 3 Production 4 Reception 5 Novel and comic book adaptations 6 References 7 External links Plot[edit] British botanist Dr. Charles Decker (Michael Gough) comes back from Africa after a year, presumed dead. During that year, he came across a way of growing plants and animals to an enormous size. He brings back a baby chimpanzee, named Konga, to test out his theory. Decker goes insane after he discovers a serum that turns his chimpanzee subject into a ferocious gorilla-sized ape. To further his hideous experiments, he mesmerizes the ape and sends it to London to kill all of his enemies who have more credit in the scientific community than he already has. Among his targets are Dean Foster (Austin Trevor), Professor Tagore (George Pastell), and Bob Kenton (Jess Conrad), the lover of Sandra Banks (Claire Gordon), the woman that the doctor wants for himself. After Konga strangles Bob Kenton to death, Decker attempts to make Sandra his own. This does not sit well with Margaret (Margo Johns), the botanist's assistant and current girlfriend, who attempts to get even by giving Konga an enormous amount of the strange serum and turns him into an enormous monster, although she becomes his first victim. Just before going on a rampage, the super-sized ape grabs Decker in one of his enormous hands, while Sandra's arm is eaten by Decker's carnivorous plants. His rampage comes to a stop when he and Decker are killed by the British army. Upon his death, Konga changes back to a baby chimpanzee.

As Cohen had long admired King Kong, he thought of a giant ape film shot in colour. Due to Cohen's success with his I Was a Teenage Werewolf (1957), AIP used "I Was a Teenage Gorilla" as the working title.[3] Cohen paid RKO Pictures $25,000 for the rights to the name of Kong for exploitation purposes. Cohen recalled that the special effects for the film, that was one of the first giant monster movies shot in colour (Eastmancolor), took 18 months to complete.[4] The climatic scene in London streets was possible when the producer convinced the police that the scenes could be effectively staged late at night on essentially empty streets.[Note 1] A combination of miniature sets, an actor in a gorilla suit, and use of studio mattes also made the technical aspects of the production look better than its meagre budget would otherwise have allowed.[3] An unknown (and uncredited) actor named Paul Stockman was the man inside the ape suit. In an interview, he revealed "How I came to get the part of Konga: my agent told me there was an American producer looking for a six-foot actor. Would I go to Mac’s Rehearsal Rooms, Leicester Square, London? So I toddled along; I walked into the room and there’s 20 six-foot tall blokes! I thought, “Oh, dear, it’s a lineup!” Anyway, the producer Herman Cohen came in carrying a big cardboard box. He said, “The actor I need must be exactly six foot, so if you’re six foot, one or five foot, eleven, thank you for coming but you won’t do.” So everybody left except three, two other guys and myself. The producer then opened a cardboard box and took out the gorilla headpiece. He said, “Now I’d like all three of you to try this on because the guy who gets the part will have to wear this six to eight hours a day, so see how you feel with it.” So, we each put the gorilla head on. The other two had blue eyes and I’ve got brown eyes. And we all knew a gorilla has brown eyes. So that was how I got the part!"[5][6] Reception[edit] Konga appeared as part of a double feature with Master of the World (1961). The film was reviewed in The New York Times, where the film critic Eugene Archer noted it played to "misplaced guffaws" and was further described as: "... the British 'Konga' is nothing more than an overblown 'King Kong,' hammily played by Michael Gough and an improbable-looking ape."[7] In a later Time Out film review, Konga was considered: "Inept, silly, and ludicrously enjoyable monster movie, with Gough as the mad boffin who injects a chimp with a growth serum, only to see it turn into an uncredited actor in a gorilla suit. Thereafter the ape grabs a Michael Gough doll and heads for Big Ben. Deeply political."[8] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 33% based on 6 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 4.4/10.[9] Konga Konga battles "the Creature from Uuang-Ni", from issue #23 of the Konga comic book published by Charlton Comics Publication information Publisher Charlton Comics Schedule Bi-monthly Format Ongoing series Genre Fantasy Publication date Konga: June 1960 – Nov. 1965 The Return of Konga: Jan. 1962 Konga's Revenge: summer 1963 - fall 1964 Konga's Revenge (vol. 2): 1968 No. of issues Konga: 23 The Return of Konga: 1 Konga's Revenge: 2 Konga's Revenge (vol. 2): 1 Main character(s) Konga Creative team Written by Joe Gill Artist(s) Steve Ditko Dick Giordano Rocco Mastroserio Novel and comic book adaptations[edit] A novelization of the film was released in paperback at the time of its original release (Konga by Dean Owen (Monarch Books 1960)). From 1960 to 1965, Charlton Comics published 23 issues of the comic book Konga.[10] It included work by Spider-Man co-creator Steve Ditko. The series was renamed Fantastic Giants with issue #24, which turned out to be the last issue of the series.[11][12] Konga also appeared in a three-issue miniseries that started off as The Return of Konga, before it was renamed Konga's Revenge with issue #2.[13][14] The series ran from 1962-1964. This was followed by a one-shot reprint issue in 1968.[15] In 1990, Steve Ditko illustrated a back-up story in Web of Spider-Man Annual #6 called "Child Star".[16] In this story, Captain Universe creates huge versions of toys based on Gorgo and Konga to battle giant monsters that are attacking the neighborhood. For copyright reasons, Konga's name was altered to "Kongo". This sequence was Ditko paying homage to his earlier work with these characters from the 1960s Charlton Comics comic books. Some of these issues were reprinted (in black and white) in a trade paperback in 2011 called Angry Apes n' Leapin Lizards.[17] In August 2013, IDW Publishing reprinted all the issues that artist Steve Ditko worked on (Konga #1 and 3–15 and Konga's Revenge #2) as a deluxe hardcover collection called Steve Ditko's Monsters: Konga.[18] In April 2019, IDW published a book called Konga vs. Gorgo which collected issues #5 and 6 of the series.[19] References[edit] Notes ^ The resultant mayhem was especially alarming for residents, who were awakened by sounds of gunfire.[3] Citations ^ Heffernan 2004, p. 127. ^ https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/ditko_steve.htm ^ a b c Axmaker, Seam.
