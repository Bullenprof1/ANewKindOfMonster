(September 2018) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) StarKid Productions Founded 2009 (2009) Founders Darren Criss Brian Holden Matt Lang Nick Lang Type Theatrical productions Location Los Angeles, California Affiliations University of Michigan Basement Arts Website teamstarkid.com StarKid Productions, also known as Team StarKid, is an American musical theatre company founded in 2009 at the University of Michigan by Darren Criss, Brian Holden, Matt Lang, and Nick Lang. Originally known for the viral success of their first musical, A Very Potter Musical, a parody of the Harry Potter series. The troupe primarily produces musical comedies inspired by pop culture, with original scripts, songs and music. StarKid distributes their musicals for free on YouTube, with recent projects being funded by Kickstarter and physical ticket sales. Since the success of A Very Potter Musical, the group has produced twelve stage musicals (including two Potter sequels), two world tours, two reunion concert specials, three sketch comedy shows, and three web series. As of 2020, the company has charted 12 albums chart on the Billboard charts. The cast recording of Me and My Dick debuted at number 11 on the US Cast Albums chart in 2010, becoming the first student-produced musical recording to chart on Billboard. The following year they landed at number one the same chart with the cast recording of Starship, a feat that has since been repeated with their 2019 musical Black Friday.

The members met while collaborating on plays through Basement Arts, the university's student-run theater organization. In April 2009, the students staged a musical parody of the Harry Potter series entitled A Very Potter Musical. The video of the play went viral on the Internet, garnering StarKid a worldwide fanbase. Inspired by the viral nature of the video, StarKid Productions was formed, named after a quote from A Very Potter Musical. Later, two sequels were performed and released on YouTube, A Very Potter Sequel in 2010 and A Very Potter Senior Year in 2012.[1][2] The Team StarKid YouTube channel was established on June 19, 2009.[3] The channel currently has over 650,000 subscribers and over 274,000,000 combined views.[3] Aside from the viral Harry Potter adaptions, Team StarKid have produced a number of other musical theatre parody shows, creating both original stories and pop culture-based parodies of Disney, DC Comics, Star Wars, and The Oregon Trail. Team Starkid has had two major moves since its founding in 2009. The first was to Chicago after the founders graduated from The University of Michigan. Several shows were performed in Chicago before the company moved once again, this time to Los Angeles. Starkid has most recently gained attention for their Hatchetfield series of musicals and short films. The series began in 2018 with the musical, The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals.[4] and continued in 2019 with the premiere of Black Friday.[5] Future installments of the series have been announced, including “Workin’ Boys”, a short film spin-off of The Guy Who Didn’t Like Musicals , and a new musical titled Nerdy Prudes Must Die.[6] Musical theatre productions[edit] Production Dates Location Music & Lyrics Book Notes A Very Potter Musical April 9–11, 2009 University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI Darren Criss, A.

However, it was a one-time "theatrical reading" and, as such, Team StarKid does not include it in their musical canon.[7] The story followed the adventures of the android Mega-Girl and her half-witted Starship Ranger husband, Tootsie Noodles, as the newlyweds go to visit Mega-Girl's human-hating family.[8] An audio recording of Starship: Requiem was created as a perk for those who helped fund the musical Firebringer, featuring music by the band Jim and the Povolos, which included numerous members of Team Starkid. A production of A Very Potter Christmas was also included,[9] which served a sneak peek into the lives of the cast after graduation while also flashing back to the era of Lily and James Potter. Although both recordings were intended to arrive on Christmas of 2016, Starship: Requiem would not see a release until sometime in February 2018.[10] Concerts and tours[edit] The SPACE Tour (2011) — North American concert tour with 21 stops in 15 cities. "SPACE" in the tour title stands for StarKid Precarious Auditory Concert Experience.[11] Featuring: Jaime Lyn Beatty, Brian Holden, Lauren Lopez, Joey Richter, Dylan Saunders, Meredith Stepien, and Joe Walker. Guest appearances from other members of Team Starkid included Tyler Brunsman, Britney Coleman, Corey Dorris, Elona Finlay, Joe Moses, and "Eastwick"'s Darren Criss. Also appearing on the tour for guest performances were George Watsky, and The Gregory Brothers. Apocalyptour (2012) — 2012 North American concert tour with 24 stops in 21 cities. The tour title is a reference to the 2012 phenomenon.[12] Featuring: Jaime Lyn Beatty, Brian Holden, Lauren Lopez, Jim Povolo, Joey Richter, Brian Rosenthal, Dylan Saunders, Meredith Stepien, and Joe Walker. The band included Charlene Kaye, Clark Baxtresser, Megan Cox, Dave Scalia, and Tomek Miernowski.

StarKid Productions teamed up with The Second City to produce their first sketch comedy show. The show was produced at the UP Comedy Club. 1Night 2Last 3Ever: September–November 2013, Chicago, IL. StarKid Productions second sketch comedy show with The Second City. The show was produced at the UP Comedy Club. The show was a parody of various pieces of 1990s pop culture centering on the exploits of a fictional boy band, 3Ever. Yes, I am Afraid of the Dark!: September–October 2015, Chicago, IL. StarKid Productions first improv comedy show with iO Chicago and was produced at the iO Theater. The show was a parody of the 1990s children show Are You Afraid of the Dark? with the cast creating an entire episode based on audience suggestion. Web series[edit] Little White Lie[edit] In 2007, members including Matt Lang, Nick Lang, Eric Kahn Gale, Brian Holden, Darren Criss, Lauren Lopez, Elona Finlay, Chris Allen, Meredith Stepien, and Jim Povolo produced an online video series called Little White Lie. It was released in 2009 on StarKid's YouTube channel.[16] Despite the series ending in a cliffhanger, StarKid members have confirmed at various events that there will be no season 2, as it was an expensive production and the actors who took part in it are scattered all over the country. However, Eric Kahn Gale, one of the writers for the show, stated that he would write and publish a synopsis of season 2, which was released on September 3, 2013 on his Tumblr page.[17] Movies, Musicals, and Me[edit] In October 2017, StarKid debuted its second web series on YouTube, Movies, Musicals, and Me. The series takes place in an alternate world where every popular movie ever has been adapted into a Broadway musical. The best of these musicals all star the same man, Halpert Evans, a vain and pompous, though brilliant, actor. The series is structured as a mocumentary of Evans, chronicling the most significant musical roles of his career, along with commentary from various colleagues in Halpert's line of work. The series introduces StarKid newcomers Esther Fallick as Halpert Evans and Mary Kate Wiles as Judy Davendale. Joey Richter, Nick Lang, Brian Holden, Dylan Saunders, Lauren Lopez, Jaime Lyn Beatty, Corey Dorris, and Clark Baxtresser also star. Nightmare Time[edit] On October 1, 2020 StarKid announced a new three-episode horror anthology series set in the world of The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals and Black Friday. It will feature six stories read by the cast of the shows (Jaime Lyn Beatty, Jeff Blim, Corey Dorris, Mariah Rose Faith, Angela Giarratana, Lauren Lopez, Robert Manion, Jon Matteson, Curt Mega, Joey Richter, Dylan Saunders, James Tolbert, Kim Whalen, & Kendall Nicole Yakshe.) Performances took place virtually on October 10, 17, and 24, 2020.[18] A cast recording was released on February 8, 2021.[19] Soundtrack albums[edit] Title Album details Peak chart positions Notes US US Cast US Comedy US Comp.
