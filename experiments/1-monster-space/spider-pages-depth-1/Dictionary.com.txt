In 2010, Dictionary.com began a Word of the Year feature with the word 'change'.[12] The selection is based on search trends on the site throughout the year and the news events that drive them.[13] Dictionary.com's words of the year have been:[12] 2010: Change 2011: Tergiversate 2012: Bluster 2013: Privacy 2014: Exposure 2015: Identity 2016: Xenophobia 2017: Complicit 2018: Misinformation 2019: Existential[13] 2020: Pandemic[14] In April 2009, they launched an app on the App Store allowing users to find definitions and synonyms. It also included audio pronunciations, alphabetical indexing, and synonym example sentences.[15] Since then, Dictionary.com released a standalone thesaurus app called Thesaurus Rex along with education apps, Dictionary.com Flashcards, Word Dynamo, and Learning to Read with Zoo Animals. In early 2020, in response to COVID-19 quarantine home-schooling needs, Dictionary.com launched a Learning at Home Center platform.[16] The coronavirus outbreak led to the addition of novel words to the main dictionary (e.g., fomites) and the slang dictionary (e.g., ‘rona’).[17] See also[edit] Lexico Lists of dictionaries References[edit] ^ "Dictionary.com WHOIS, DNS, & Domain Info - DomainTools". whois.domaintools.com.
