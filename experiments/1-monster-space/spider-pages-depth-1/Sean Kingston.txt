At Beluga we essentially refine the talent so that it's more of a marketable product."[9] In a venture between Epic Records and Koch Records, Kingston recorded and released the single "Beautiful Girls" in May 2007.[10] The song peaked at the top of the Billboard Hot 100. "Beautiful Girls" was a success internationally, topping the charts in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom.
