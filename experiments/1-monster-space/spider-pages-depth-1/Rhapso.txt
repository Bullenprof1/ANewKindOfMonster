In Greek mythology, Rhapso[pronunciation?] (Greek: Ῥαψώ) was a nymph or a minor goddess worshipped at Athens. She is known solely from an inscription of the 4th century BCE, found at Phaleron.[1] Her name apparently derives from the Greek verb ῥάπτω "to sew" or "to stitch". According to some, she is associated with the Moirai (as a fate goddess) and Eileithyia (as a birth goddess); she somehow organized a man's thread of life, at birth, by some sort of stitching work (similar to Clotho of the Moirai). And according to others, she was possibly a patroness of seamstresses.[2] Notes[edit] ^ Inscriptiones Graecae, 22, 4547 ^ Rice-Stambaugh 2009, p. 114 References[edit] H. G. Liddel, R. Scott, H.
