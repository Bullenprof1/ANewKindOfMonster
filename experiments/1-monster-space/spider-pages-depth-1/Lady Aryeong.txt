1st century BCE Korean kingdom of Silla founder's wife API Hangul 알영부인 Hanja 閼英夫人 Revised Romanization Aryŏng Buin McCune–Reischauer Aryeong Buin Lady Aryeong (Korean: 알영부인; Hanja: 閼英夫人, a.k.a. Al-yeong, Al-yong) was a daughter of Lady Saso who was from the Chinese royal family and moved to the Jinhan confederacy.[1][2][3] She was married to Hyeokgeose of Silla who was the founder of Silla and he was also a son of Lady Saso.[1] According to Samguk Yusa (Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms), Aryeong was born from the left side of the dragon which appeared near the well. However, the Samguk Sagi (History of the Three Kingdoms), says it was the right side. According to the Buddhist monk Il-yeon, the “dragon” in these histories refers to Lady Saso.[3] Contents 1 Outline 2 Family 3 Worship 4 References Outline[edit] The following description is from the Samguk Yusa (Memorabilia of the three Kingdoms), volume 5, clause 7. 其始到辰韓也。生聖子為東國始君。蓋赫居閼英二聖之所自也。故稱雞龍雞林白馬等。雞屬西故也。嘗使諸天仙織羅。緋染作朝衣。贈其夫。國人因此始知神驗。 She came to the Jinhan confederacy in the beginning, gave birth to sacred children and became the first king of the eastern country. Probably those children were Aryeong and Hyeokgeose of Silla. That’s why they are called Gye-Nong (Hangul:계농), Gye-Rim (Hangul:계림), Baek-Ma (Hangul:백마) and so on: because Gye (Hangul:계) belongs to the west side. One day, Saso made a fairy of the heavens weave silk cloth, dye it in scarlet and make a Korean garment. She sent this garment to her husband. This was the first time people in the country knew of her miracles.
