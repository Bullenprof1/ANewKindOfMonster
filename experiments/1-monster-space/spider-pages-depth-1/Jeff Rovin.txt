His How to Play video game books of the 1980s and 1990s detailed strategies for dozens of games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, and Game Boy. This series was preceded by his The Complete Guide to Conquering Video Games in 1982, and followed by his Gamemaster series that lasted until the late 1990s, which began containing a violence rating for the games included in these books. Rovin's publisher at the time, St. Martin's, later decided to continue the "How To Win At", series, but this time written by Hank Schlesinger, to cover Nintendo 64, PlayStation games, and Pok√©mon. Rovin has written encyclopedias about popular culture, including The Encyclopedia of Superheroes (Facts On File, 1985), The Encyclopedia of Super Villains (Facts On File, 1987) The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Cartoon Animals (Prentice Hall, 1991), and The Encyclopedia of Monsters (Checkmark Books, 1990). He has worked on biographical and film books on such performers as Kelsey Grammer, Lana Turner, Adam West, Ellen DeGeneres, Jackie Chan, Charlton Heston, Elvis Presley, Sylvester Stallone, Richard Pryor, Luke Perry, Jason Priestley, and Julio Iglesias, and on the animated series The Simpsons. Additionally, he has written quiz and joke books. Rovin's novels are in the fields of thriller, horror, adventure, and mystery, in addition to the military field with books in the Force Five and Tom Clancy's Op-Center series.[2] His Tom Clancy's Op-Center: War of Eagles became a New York Times Best Seller.[3] His later Unit Omega books were written under the name pen name Jim Grand.[4] He then began writing further military suspense novels under his own name, such as Tempest Down, Dead Rising, and Rogue Angel. In October 2016, during the last days of the Donald Trump campaign, Rovin appeared on Hannity, in Breitbart News and the front cover of Weekly World News' parent paper, National Enquirer, claiming to have been a "fixer" for Bill and Hillary Clinton, hiding family scandals.[5][6][7][8] His allegations included that Hillary Clinton was "bisexual" and a "secret sex freak" with an "open marriage" and had a romantic relationship with Vince Foster.[9][10][11] Bibliography[edit] Fiction[edit] Stand-alone novels[edit] The Hindenburg Disaster (1975) The Transgalactic Guide To Solar System M-17 (1981) The Madjan (1984) Dagger (1988) Starik (1989) - with Sander Diamond The Red Arrow (1990) - with Sander Diamond Cat Angels (1995) Vespers (1999) Stealth War (2000) Fatalis (2000) Dead Rising (2005) Tempest Down (2007) Rogue Angel (2007) The Devil's Rangers (2007) - written under the pen name Jim Grand Conversations with the Devil (2013) Coldwater (2015) Zero-G (2016) - with William Shatner Hollywood Detective[edit] Garrison (1975) The Wolf (1975) Novelizations and tie-ins[edit] April Fool's Day (1986) Re-Animator (1987) Cliffhanger (1993) Mortal Kombat (1995) - original novel based on the video game Broken Arrow (1996) The Game (1997) Return of the Wolf Man (1998) - original novel based on the Universal Monsters Force Five[edit] Destination: Algiers (1989) Destination: Stalingrad (1989) Destination: Norway (1989) Tom Clancy's Op-Center[edit] Series created by Tom Clancy and Steve Pieczenik Op-Center (1995) Mirror Image (1995) Games of State (1996) Acts of War (1997) Balance of Power (1998) State of Siege (1999) Divide and Conquer (2000) Line of Control (2001) Mission of Honor (2002) Sea of Fire (2003) Call to Treason (2004) War of Eagles (2005) For Honor (2018) Sting of the Wasp (2019) God of War (2020) Unit Omega[edit] written under the pen name Jim Grand Unit Omega (2003) Operation Medusa (2004) The EarthEnd Saga[edit] Co-written with actress Gillian Anderson A Vision of Fire (2014) A Dream of Ice (2015) The Sound of Seas (2016) Nonfiction[edit] Of Mice and Mickey (1975) A Pictorial History of Science Fiction Films (1976) From Jules Verne to Star Trek (1977) The Fabulous Fantasy Films (1977) Mars!
