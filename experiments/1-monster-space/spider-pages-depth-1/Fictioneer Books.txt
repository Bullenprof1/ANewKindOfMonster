Kraft also merged his interests in music and comics by inserting multiple references to the band Blue Öyster Cult into his Defenders stories specifically the "Xenogenesis: Day of the Demons" storyline, issues #58–60.[7] Kraft combined music and comics in his scripting of the Marvel Super Special #4 featuring The Beatles.[2] Marvel Super Special #7, an adaptation of the film Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, by Kraft and artists George Pérez and Jim Mooney was promoted on the "Bullpen Bulletins" page in Marvel Comics cover-dated January 1979. It was never published in the U.S. "because the book was late and the movie proved to be a commercial failure," according to a contemporaneous news account.[8] Kraft wrote the Man-Wolf feature in Creatures on the Loose and Marvel Premiere and featured the character in The Spectacular Spider-Man Annual #3 (1981).[9] He wrote the entire run, except the first issue, of Savage She-Hulk, which ran from 1980 to 1982. Kraft worked on such titles as Captain America and scripted the first story drawn by John Byrne for Marvel Comics: "Dark Asylum," published in Giant-Size Dracula #5 (June 1975).[10] In the early to mid-1980s Kraft wrote children's storybooks featuring Marvel characters such as Spider-Man, the Hulk, and the Fantastic Four for the Children's Press, Marvel Books and Simon & Schuster.[2] During this same time he wrote the interactive game books Ghost Knights of Camelot for Avon, and Robot Race for Scholastic books. In 1983–1984, Kraft wrote World's Finest Comics for DC Comics,[11] including that series' issue #300 (Feb. 1984).[12] After that, Kraft did occasional comics writing, but mostly focused his energies on publishing and criticism. In 1995, Kraft worked as story-editor and scripter for the short-lived animated series G.I. Joe Extreme. Kraft is the co-writer and editor of Yi Soon Shin: Warrior and Defender by Onrie Kompan Productions, LLC. Publisher, critic and literary agent[edit] Fictioneer Books[edit] In 1974, Kraft founded the specialty science fiction publisher Fictioneer Books. Over the years, Fictioneer has published books by such authors as A. E. van Vogt, Robert E. Howard, Jack London, Otis Adelbert Kline, and Don McGregor.[2] Fictioneer and its imprint Comics Interview Group published magazines including David Anthony Kraft's Comics Interview, the newspaper-comic-strip reprint magazine Comics Revue, and trade journals such as the trade text 100 Hot Tips from Top Comics Creators (1994). In early 1985 Comics Interview Group branched out into comic books by taking on Henry and Audrey Vogel's Southern Knights (previously a self-published series). In 1986 they expanded their comics lineup with MICRA and Aristocratic Xtraterrestrial Time-Traveling Thieves, and began publishing a number of Southern Knights reprints in the form of graphic novels, one-shots, and limited series. Though 1988 saw them also introduce Julie Woodcock and Brian Stelfreeze's CyCops, none of their comics publications sold as well as Southern Knights, and by the end of that year they had stopped publishing any other titles. In mid-1989 Southern Knights was canceled as well, and the Comics Interview imprint was again devoted solely to magazines and trade publications although they would co-publish Southern Knights No. 35 and 36 in 1992. Comics Interview In 1983, Kraft founded David Anthony Kraft's Comics Interview, with ran for 150 issues[13] between 1983 and 1995,[14] and garnered Eisner and Eagle Award nominations. As suggested by the title, each issue of Comics Interview was filled entirely with in-depth creator interviews. Literary agent[edit] Since 1974, Kraft has been the literary agent for the estate of pulp author Otis Adelbert Kline. Influences and personal life[edit] Kraft counts science fiction author Leigh Brackett, Stan Lee, and writer E. Hoffmann Price as mentors.[2] He currently lives in Clayton, Georgia.[citation needed] Bibliography[edit] Books[edit] Sgt.
