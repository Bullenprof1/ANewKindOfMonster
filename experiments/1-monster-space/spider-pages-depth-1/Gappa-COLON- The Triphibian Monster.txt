The reporters cage the creature and take it to Japan where it becomes a media attraction. This angers the natives of the island and Gappa's full-grown parents, who head toward Japan to find their child. Its plot virtually duplicates that of the 1961 British film Gorgo. The film was released theatrically in Japan in 1967, but only received release on television in the United States as Monster from a Prehistoric Planet. It received positive reviews from Variety and Phil Hardy. Certain shots of the Gappas attacking Japan were used in the 1991 Red Dwarf episode "Meltdown".[4] Contents 1 Plot 2 Production 3 Release 4 Reception 5 See also 6 References 6.1 Footnotes 6.2 Sources 7 External links Plot[edit] An expedition from Tokyo heads to Obelisk Island, which the greedy Mr. Funazu, president of Playmate Magazine, wants to turn into a resort. The island natives welcome the expedition, but two members, Hiroshi and Itoko, venture into a forbidden area despite the pleas of a native boy named Saki. They enter a cavern blocked by a fallen statue and find a giant egg, out of which hatches a baby "bird-lizard" monster, referred to as "Gappa". The natives plead with the skeptical scientists not to take the baby away, lest it anger the baby's parents, but they do so anyway. Inside the caverns, Gappa's two parents rise from the subterranean waters beneath the volcano, destroying everything in their path. Saki, the only survivor, is rescued by an American Navy fleet and brought to Japan. Meanwhile, Gappa makes global headlines and is experimented on by scientists. To the shock of the expedition members, two giant flying creatures appear over Sagami Bay. The Gappa parents ravage cities looking for their offspring and prove impervious to military weapons. Hiroshi, Itoko, Saki, and expedition scientist Professor Tonooka try to convince the headstrong Mr. Funazu to let the baby go and return it to its parents. Production[edit] Gappa the Triphibian Monster was the only kaiju eiga from Nikkatsu.[5] The monster effects in the film were created by Akira Watanabe, a former employee of Toho.[5] The English language dialogue in the film's English version is credited to William Ross.[6][7] Release[edit] Gappa the Triphibian Monster was released in Japan on April 22, 1967 as Daikyojū Gappa.[1][8] The film was never released theatrically in the United States.[9] American International Television first offered the film as Monster from a Prehistoric Planet[10][11] in the "15 New Science Fiction" television package beginning in 1967;[12] the film may have premiered on television in 1968.[1] Stuart Galbraith IV, author of Japanese Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films described the American version of the film as poorly dubbed and that home video versions prior to 1994 are poor dupes taken from a 16mm television print.[9] The film has been released on DVD by various companies including Alpha Video, Mill Creek Entertainment, Tokyo Shock and Image Entertainment.[13] Reception[edit] In contemporary reviews, Variety stated that the creature Gappa makes an "auspicious debut and reveals itself as "best monster" so far".[14] Variety concluded that "these are the only Japanese monsters one might like to see again" and that "Most effects are well done, a few superb" noting the destruction of Atami as one of the highlights.[14] In retrospective reviews, Phil Hardy discussed the film in his book Science Fiction (1984).[15] The review complemented the film, noting that "the effects are excellent and the script is worthy of a witty children's comedy."[15] Stuart Galbraith IV described the film as an unauthorized remake of the 1961 British film Gorgo.[16] Galbraith described the human characters as "colorless reporters and scientists" and that "none of the actors is especially appealing."[5] Galbraith commented on Akira Watanabe's effects, opining that they were "okay but lack the perfectionist drive of Eiji Tsuburaya's work."[5] See also[edit] List of films in the public domain in the United States List of Japanese films of 1967 List of science fiction films of the 1960s References[edit] Footnotes[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i Galbraith IV 1994, p. 314. sfn error: no target: CITEREFGalbraith_IV1994 (help) ^ Galbraith IV 1998, p. 188. sfn error: no target: CITEREFGalbraith_IV1998 (help) ^ O'Neill 1994, p. 235. sfn error: no target: CITEREFO'Neill1994 (help) ^ "In the Stocks".
