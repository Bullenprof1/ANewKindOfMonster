The historic film Reefer Madness (1936) has also become popular as a "stoner movie" because its anti-drug message is seen by some modern viewers as so over the top that the film amounts to self-parody.[citation needed] Other examples include Assassin of Youth (1937), Marihuana (1936) and She Shoulda Said No! a.k.a. The Devil's Weed (1949). Playing on such parody, a musical comedy remake set in 1936 (as the original film was), Reefer Madness, was released in 2005. High Times magazine regularly sponsors the Stony Awards to celebrate stoner films and television. Many of these films do not fit the category of "stoner film" as a subgenre, but contain enough cannabis use to be deemed noteworthy by the periodical. Common elements[edit] Many stoner movies have certain elements and themes in common.[2][3] The template involves a protagonist or protagonists (often two friends in a variation of the buddy film) who have or are attempting to find marijuana and have some task to complete. Often stoner films involve evading authority figures, sometimes law-enforcement agents, who are portrayed as comically inept, but also parents, co-workers, friends, and security guards, who disapprove of the protagonists' marijuana usage, usually out of a greater lack of acceptance of their lifestyle of leisure and innocence. Most serious moments are intended ironically, often to parody overwrought counterparts in mainstream cinema. The comic story arcs often approach or fall over the line into slapstick.[2] Notable stoner films[edit] Jewel Robbery (1932) Reefer Madness (1936) Easy Rider (1969) Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970) Fritz the Cat (1972) The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat (1974) Cheech & Chong's Up in Smoke (1978) Rockers (1978) Cheech & Chong's Next Movie (1980) Cheech & Chong's Nice Dreams (1981) Things Are Tough All Over (1982) Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) Still Smokin' (1983) Les Frères Pétard (1986) Class of Nuke 'Em High (1986) Far Out Man (1990) London Kills Me (1991) Dazed and Confused (1993) The Stöned Age (1994) PCU (1994) Friday (1995) Bio-Dome (1996) Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996) Bongwater (1997) Half Baked (1998) Around the Fire (1998) Harvest (1998) Social Intercourse (1998) Homegrown (1998) Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) Dead Man on Campus (1998) Detroit Rock City (1999) Blowin' Smoke (1999) Human Traffic (1999) Outside Providence (1999) Dude, Where's My Car?
