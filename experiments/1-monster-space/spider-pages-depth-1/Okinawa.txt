Naha is the capital and largest city of Okinawa Prefecture, with other major cities including Okinawa, Uruma, and Urasoe.[3] Okinawa Prefecture encompasses two thirds of the Ryukyu Islands, including the Okinawa, Daitō and Sakishima groups, extending 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) southwest from the Satsunan Islands of Kagoshima Prefecture to Taiwan (Hualien and Yilan Counties). Okinawa Prefecture's largest island, Okinawa Island, is the smallest, and southernmost of the Japan's main islands and home to a majority of the population. Okinawa Prefecture's indigenous ethnic group are the Ryukyuan people, who also live in the Amami Islands of Kagoshima Prefecture. Okinawa Prefecture was ruled by the Ryukyu Kingdom from 1429 and unofficially annexed by Japan after the Invasion of Ryukyu in 1609. Okinawa Prefecture was officially founded in 1879 by the Empire of Japan after seven years as the Ryukyu Domain, the last domain of the Han system. Okinawa Prefecture was occupied by the United States of America during the Allied occupation of Japan after World War II, and governed by the Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands from 1945 to 1950 and Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands from 1950 until the prefecture was returned to Japan in 1972. Okinawa Prefecture comprises just 0.6 percent of Japan's total land mass but about 26,000 (75%) of United States Forces Japan personnel are assigned to the prefecture; the continued U.S. military presence in Okinawa is controversial.[4][5] Nago, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan Contents 1 History 1.1 1945–1965 1.1.1 Continued U.S. military buildup 1.1.2 Secret U.S. deployment of nuclear weapons 1.2 1965–1972 (Vietnam War) 1.3 1973–2006 1.4 2007–present 1.4.1 Marine Corps Air Station Futenma relocation, 2006–present 1.4.2 Helipads construction in Takae (Yanbaru forest) 2 Geography 2.1 Major islands 2.2 Cities 2.3 Towns and villages 2.4 Town mergers 2.5 Natural parks 2.6 Fauna 2.7 Flora 2.8 Geology 2.9 Climate 3 Demography 3.1 Ethnic groups 3.2 Population 4 Language and culture 4.1 Language 4.2 Religion 4.3 Cultural influences 4.4 Other cultural characteristics 4.5 Karate 4.6 Architecture 5 Education 6 Sports 7 Transportation 7.1 Air transportation 7.2 Highways 7.3 Rail 7.4 Ports 8 Economy 9 Military 9.1 United States military installations 10 Notable people 11 See also 12 Notes 13 References 14 External links History[edit] History of Ryukyu Periods Prehistoric pre–14,000 BC Early Shell Mound 14,000–300 BC Middle Shell Mound 300 BC–750 AD Late Shell Mound 750–1187 Gusuku 1187–1314 Sanzan 1314–1429 Hokuzan 1314?–1416 Chūzan 1314?–1429 Nanzan 1314?–1429 Ryukyu Kingdom 1429–1879 First Shō dynasty 1429–1469 Second Shō dynasty 1469–1879 Satsuma Invasion 1609 Ryūkyū Domain 1872–1879 Japanese Annexation 1879 Meiji 1879–1912 Taishō 1912–1926 Pre-World War II 1926–1945 Militarism Battle of Okinawa 1945 U.

Also during this period, many Gusukus, similar to castles, were constructed. The Ryukyu Kingdom entered into the Imperial Chinese tributary system under the Ming dynasty beginning in the 15th century, which established economic relations between the two nations. In 1609, the Shimazu clan, which controlled the region that is now Kagoshima Prefecture, invaded the Ryukyu Kingdom. The Ryukyu Kingdom was obliged to agree to form a suzerain-vassal relationship with the Satsuma and the Tokugawa shogunate, while maintaining its previous role within the Chinese tributary system; Ryukyuan sovereignty was maintained since complete annexation would have created a conflict with China. The Satsuma clan earned considerable profits from trade with China during a period in which foreign trade was heavily restricted by the shogunate. A Ryukyuan embassy in Edo. Although Satsuma maintained strong influence over the islands, the Ryukyu Kingdom maintained a considerable degree of domestic political freedom for over two hundred years. Four years after the 1868 Meiji Restoration, the Japanese government, through military incursions, officially annexed the kingdom and renamed it Ryukyu han. At the time, the Qing Empire asserted a nominal suzerainty over the islands of the Ryukyu Kingdom, since the Ryūkyū Kingdom was also a member state of the Chinese tributary system. Ryukyu han became Okinawa Prefecture of Japan in 1879, even though all other hans had become prefectures of Japan in 1872. In 1912, Okinawans first obtained the right to vote for representatives to the National Diet (国会) which had been established in 1890.[16] 1945–1965[edit] Near the end of World War II, in 1945, the US Army and Marine Corps invaded Okinawa with 185,000 troops. A third of Okinawa's civilian population died;[17] a quarter of the civilian population died during the 1945 Battle of Okinawa alone.[18] The dead, of all nationalities, are commemorated at the Cornerstone of Peace. After the end of World War II, the United States set up the United States Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands administration, which ruled Okinawa for 27 years. During this "trusteeship rule", the United States established numerous military bases on the Ryukyu islands. The Ryukyu independence movement was an Okinawan movement that clamored against U.S. rule. Continued U.S. military buildup[edit] During the Korean War, B-29 Superfortresses flew bombing missions over Korea from Kadena Air Base on Okinawa. The military buildup on the island during the Cold War increased a division between local inhabitants and the American military. Under the 1952 Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan, United States Forces Japan (USFJ) have maintained a large military presence. During the mid-1950s, the U.S. seized land from Okinawans to build new bases or expand currently-existing ones. According to the Melvin Price Report, by 1955, the military had displaced 250,000 residents.[19] Secret U.S. deployment of nuclear weapons[edit] Since 1960, the U.S. and Japan have maintained an agreement that allows the U.S. to secretly bring nuclear weapons into Japanese ports.[20][21][22] The Japanese people tended to oppose the introduction of nuclear arms into Japanese territory[23] and the Japanese government's assertion of Japan's non-nuclear policy and a statement of the Three Non-Nuclear Principles reflected this popular opposition. Most of the weapons were alleged to be stored in ammunition bunkers at Kadena Air Base.[24] Between 1954 and 1972, 19 different types of nuclear weapons were deployed in Okinawa, but with fewer than around 1,000 warheads at any one time.[25] In Fall 1960, U.S. commandos in Green Light Teams secret training missions carried actual small nuclear weapons on the east coast of Okinawa Island.[26] 1965–1972 (Vietnam War)[edit] Between 1965 and 1972, Okinawa was a key staging point for United States in its military operations directed towards North Vietnam. Along with Guam, it presented a geographically strategic launch pad for covert bombing missions over Cambodia and Laos.[27] Anti-Vietnam War sentiment became linked politically to the movement for reversion of Okinawa to Japan. In 1965, the US military bases, earlier viewed as paternal post war protection, were increasingly seen as aggressive. The Vietnam War highlighted the differences between United States and Okinawa, but showed a commonality between the islands and mainland Japan.[28] As controversy grew regarding the alleged placement of nuclear weapons on Okinawa, fears intensified over the escalation of the Vietnam War. Okinawa was then perceived, by some inside Japan, as a potential target for China, should the communist government feel threatened by United States.[29] American military secrecy blocked any local reporting on what was actually occurring at bases such as Kadena Air Base. As information leaked out, and images of air strikes were published, the local population began to fear the potential for retaliation.[28] Political leaders such as Oda Makoto, a major figure in the Beheiren movement (Foundation of Citizens for Peace in Vietnam), believed, that the return of Okinawa to Japan would lead to the removal of U.S. forces ending Japan's involvement in Vietnam.[30] In a speech delivered in 1967 Oda was critical of Prime Minister Sato's unilateral support of America's War in Vietnam claiming "Realistically we are all guilty of complicity in the Vietnam War".[30] The Beheiren became a more visible anti-war movement on Okinawa as the American involvement in Vietnam intensified. The movement employed tactics ranging from demonstrations, to handing leaflets to soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines directly, warning of the implications for a third World War.[31] The US military bases on Okinawa became a focal point for anti-Vietnam War sentiment. By 1969, over 50,000 American military personnel were stationed on Okinawa.[32] United States Department of Defense began referring to Okinawa as "The Keystone of the Pacific". This slogan was imprinted on local U.S. military license plates.[33] In 1969, chemical weapons leaked from the US storage depot at Chibana in central Okinawa, under Operation Red Hat. Evacuations of residents took place over a wide area for two months. Even two years later, government investigators found that Okinawans and the environment near the leak were still suffering because of the depot.[34] In 1972, the U.S. government handed over the islands to Japanese administration.[35] 1973–2006[edit] In a 1981 interview with the Mainichi Shimbun, Edwin O. Reischauer, former U.S. ambassador to Japan, said that U.S. naval ships armed with nuclear weapons stopped at Japanese ports on a routine duty, and this was approved by the Japanese government.[citation needed] The 1995 rape of a 12-year-old girl by U.S. servicemen triggered large protests in Okinawa. Reports by the local media of accidents and crimes committed by U.S. servicemen have reduced the local population's support for the U.S. military bases. A strong emotional response has emerged from certain incidents. As a result, the media has drawn renewed interest in the Ryukyu independence movement. Documents declassified in 1997 proved that both tactical and strategic weapons have been maintained in Okinawa.[34][36] In 1999 and 2002, the Japan Times and the Okinawa Times reported speculation that not all weapons were removed from Okinawa.[37][38] On October 25, 2005, after a decade of negotiations, the governments of the US and Japan officially agreed to move Marine Corps Air Station Futenma from its location in the densely populated city of Ginowan to the more northerly and remote Camp Schwab in Nago by building a heliport with a shorter runway, partly on Camp Schwab land and partly running into the sea.[17] The move is partly an attempt to relieve tensions between the people of Okinawa and the Marine Corps. Okinawa prefecture constitutes 0.6 percent of Japan's land surface,[17] yet as of 2006[update], 75 percent of all USFJ bases were located on Okinawa, and U.S. military bases occupied 18 percent of the main island.[39] U.S. military facilities in Okinawa 2007–present[edit] According to a 2007 Okinawa Times poll, 85 percent of Okinawans opposed the presence of the U.S. military,[40] because of noise pollution from military drills, the risk of aircraft accidents,[note 5] environmental degradation,[41] and crowding from the number of personnel there,[42] although 73.4 percent of Japanese citizens appreciated the mutual security treaty with the U.S. and the presence of the USFJ.[43] In another poll conducted by the Asahi Shimbun in May 2010, 43 percent of the Okinawan population wanted the complete closure of the U.S. bases, 42 percent wanted reduction and 11 percent wanted the maintenance of the status quo.[44] Okinawan feelings about the U.S. military are complex, and some of the resentment towards the U.S. bases is directed towards the government in Tokyo, perceived as being insensitive to Okinawan needs and using Okinawa to house bases not desired elsewhere in Japan. In early 2008, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice apologized after a series of crimes involving American troops in Japan, including the rape of a young girl of 14 by a Marine on Okinawa. The U.S. military also imposed a temporary 24-hour curfew on military personnel and their families to ease the anger of local residents.[45] Some cited statistics that the crime rate of military personnel is consistently less than that of the general Okinawan population.[46] However, some criticized the statistics as unreliable, since violence against women is under-reported.[47] Between 1972 and 2009, U.S. servicemen committed 5,634 criminal offenses, including 25 murders, 385 burglaries, 25 arsons, 127 rapes, 306 assaults and 2,827 thefts.[18] Yet, per Marine Corps Installations Pacific data, U.S. service members are convicted of far fewer crimes than local Okinawans.[48] In 2009, a new Japanese government came to power and froze the US forces relocation plan, but in April 2010 indicated their interest in resolving the issue by proposing a modified plan.[49] A study done in 2010 found that the prolonged exposure to aircraft noise around the Kadena Air Base and other military bases cause health issues such as a disrupted sleep pattern, high blood pressure, weakening of the immune system in children, and a loss of hearing.[50] In 2011, it was reported that the U.S. military—contrary to repeated denials by the Pentagon—had kept tens of thousands of barrels of Agent Orange on the island. The Japanese and American governments have angered some U.S. veterans, who believe they were poisoned by Agent Orange while serving on the island, by characterizing their statements regarding Agent Orange as "dubious", and ignoring their requests for compensation. Reports that more than a third of the barrels developed leaks have led Okinawans to ask for environmental investigations, but as of 2012[update] both Tokyo and Washington refused such action.[51] Jon Mitchell has reported concern that the U.S. used American Marines as chemical-agent guinea pigs.[52] On September 30, 2018, Denny Tamaki was elected as the next governor of Okinawa prefecture, after a campaign focused on sharply reducing the U.S. military presence on the island.[53] Marine Corps Air Station Futenma relocation, 2006–present[edit] Main article: Relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma As of December 2014[update], one ongoing issue is the relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. First promised to be moved off the island and then later within the island, as of November 2014[update] the future of any relocation is uncertain with the election of base-opponent Onaga as Okinawa governor.[54] Onaga won against the incumbent Nakaima who had earlier approved landfill work to move the base to Camp Schwab in Henoko. However, Onaga has promised to veto the landfill work needed for the new base to be built and insisted Futenma should be moved outside of Okinawa.[55] As of 2006[update], some 8,000 U.S. Marines were removed from the island and relocated to Guam.[56] In November 2008, U.S. Pacific Command Commander Admiral Timothy Keating stated the move to Guam would probably not be completed before 2015.[57] In 2009, Japan's former foreign minister Katsuya Okada stated that he wanted to review the deployment of U.S. troops in Japan to ease the burden on the people of Okinawa (Associated Press, October 7, 2009)[citation needed] 5,000 of 9,000 Marines will be deployed at Guam and the rest will be deployed at Hawaii and Australia. Japan will pay $3.1 billion cash for the moving and for developing joint training ranges on Guam and on Tinian and Pagan in the U.S.-controlled Northern Mariana Islands.[58][59][60] As of 2014[update], the US still maintains Air Force, Marine, Navy, and Army military installations on the islands. These bases include Kadena Air Base, Camp Foster, Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, Camp Hansen, Camp Schwab, Torii Station, Camp Kinser, and Camp Gonsalves. The area of 14 U.S. bases are 233 square kilometres (90 sq mi), occupying 18 percent of the main island. Okinawa hosts about two-thirds of the 50,000 American forces in Japan although the islands account for less than one percent of total lands in Japan.[39] Suburbs have grown towards and now surround two historic major bases, Futenma and Kadena. One third (9,852 acres (39.87 km2))[citation needed] of the land used by the U.S. military is the Marine Corps Northern Training Area (known also as Camp Gonsalves or JWTC) in the north of the island.[61] On December 21, 2016, 10,000 acres of Okinawa Northern Training Area was returned to Japan.[62] On June 25, 2018, Okinawa residents held a protest demonstration at sea against scheduled land reclamation work for the relocation of a U.S. military base within Japan's southernmost island prefecture. A protest gathered hundreds of people.[63] Helipads construction in Takae (Yanbaru forest)[edit] Since the early 2000s, Okinawans have opposed the presence of American troops helipads in the Takae zone of the Yanbaru forest near Higashi and Kunigami.[64] This opposition grew in July 2016 after the construction of six new helipads.[65][66] Geography[edit] Main article: Ryukyu Islands Major islands[edit] The islands of Okinawa Prefecture The islands comprising the prefecture are the southern two thirds of the archipelago of the Ryūkyū Islands (琉球諸島, Ryūkyū-shotō). Okinawa's inhabited islands are typically divided into three geographical archipelagos. From northeast to southwest: Okinawa Islands (沖縄諸島, Okinawa Shotō) Ie-jima (ii-shima) Kume-jima (kumijima) Okinawa Island (uchinaa) Kerama Islands (kirama) Miyako Islands (naaku) Miyako-jima Yaeyama Islands (eema) Iriomote-jima (iriumuti) Ishigaki Island (ishigachi) Yonaguni (dunan) Senkaku Islands (Yukunkubajima) Daitō Islands (Ufuagarijima) Minamidaitōjima (Fee ufuagarijima) Kitadaitōjima (Nishi ufuagarijima) Okidaitōjima (Uchiufuagarijima) Cities[edit] See also: List of cities in Okinawa Prefecture by population Map of Okinawa Prefecture      City      Town      Village Ishigaki Naha Eleven cities are located within the Okinawa Prefecture: Name Area (km2) Population Map Rōmaji Kanji Okinawan rōmaji (Japanese script in brackets) other languages [script] (name in brackets) Ginowan 宜野湾市 Jinōn (じのーん) 19.51 94,405 Ishigaki 石垣市 Ishigachi (イシガチ) Isïgaksï, Ishanagzï (Yaeyama) 229 47,562 Itoman 糸満市 Ichiman, Ichuman (イチマン,イチュマン) 46.63 59,605 Miyakojima 宮古島市 Naaku (ミャークズマ) Myaaku (Miyakoan) 204.54 54,908 Nago 名護市 Nagu (ナグ) Naguu [ナグー] (Kunigami) 210.37 61,659 Naha (capital) 那覇市 Nāfa, Nafa (ナーファ,ナファ) 39.98 317,405 Nanjō 南城市 Nanjoo (ナンジョー) 49.69 41,305 Okinawa 沖縄市 Uchinaa (ウチナー) 49 138,431 Tomigusuku 豊見城市 Tumigushiku (トゥミグシク) 19.6 61,613 Urasoe 浦添市 Urashii (ウラシー) 19.09 113,992 Uruma うるま市 Uruma (ウルマ) 86 118,330 Towns and villages[edit] These are the towns and villages in each district: Name Area (km2) Population District Type Map Rōmaji Kanji Okinawan rōmaji (Japanese script in brackets) other languages [script] (name in brackets) Aguni 粟国村 Aguni (アグニ) 7.63 772 Shimajiri District Village Chatan 北谷町 Chatan (チャタン) 13.62 28,578 Nakagami District Town Ginoza 宜野座村 Jinuza (ギヌヂャ) 31.28 5,544 Kunigami District Village Haebaru 南風原町 Feebaru (フェーバル) 10.72 37,874 Shimajiri District Town Higashi 東村 Agarijima (アガリジマ) Agaarijimaa [アガーリジマー] (Kunigami) 81.79 1,683 Kunigami District Village Ie 伊江村 Ii (イー) Ii [イー] (Kunigami) 22.75 4,192 Kunigami District Village Iheya 伊平屋村 Ihyaa, Kushijii (イッピャー,後地) 21.72 1,214 Shimajiri District Village Izena 伊是名村 Ijina, Meejii (イヂーナ,前地) 15.42 1,518 Shimajiri District Village Kadena 嘉手納町 Kadina (カディナ) 15.04 13,671 Nakagami District Town Kin 金武町 Chin (チン) Chin [チン] (Kunigami) 37.57 11,259 Kunigami District Town Kitadaitō 北大東村 Ufuagarijima 13.1 615 Shimajiri District Village Kitanakagusuku 北中城村 Kitanakagushiku (キタナカグシク) 11.53 16,040 Nakagami District Village Kumejima 久米島町 Kumishima 63.5 7,647 Shimajiri District Town Kunigami 国頭村 Kunjan Kunzan (Kunigami) 194.8 4,908 Kunigami District Village Minamidaitō 南大東村 30.57 1,418 Shimajiri District Village Motobu 本部町 Mutubu Mutubu (Kunigami) 54.3 13,441 Kunigami District Town Nakagusuku 中城村 Nakagushiku 15.46 20,030 Nakagami District Village Nakijin 今帰仁村 Nachijin Nachizin (Kunigami) 39.87 9,529 Kunigami District Village Nishihara 西原町 Nishibaru (ニシバル) 15.84 34,463 Nakagami District Town Ōgimi 大宜味村 Ufujimi Uujimii (Kunigami) 63.12 3,024 Kunigami District Village Onna 恩納村 Unna Unna (Kunigami) 50.77 10,443 Kunigami District Village Tarama 多良間村 Tarama Tarama (Miyakoan) 21.91 1,194 Miyako District Village Taketomi 竹富町 Dakidun Teedun (Yaeyama) 334.02 4,050 Yaeyama District Town Tokashiki 渡嘉敷村 Tukashichi 19.18 697 Shimajiri District Village Tonaki 渡名喜村 Tunachi (トゥナチ) 3.74 406 Shimajiri District Village Yaese 八重瀬町 Eeji 26.9 29,488 Shimajiri District Town Yomitan 読谷村 Yuntan 35.17 40,517 Nakagami District Village Yonabaru 与那原町 Yunabaru 5.18 18,410 Shimajiri District Town Yonaguni 与那国町 Yunaguni Dunan, Juni (Yonaguni) Yunoon (Yaeyama) 28.95 2,048 Yaeyama District Town Zamami 座間味村 Kushigiruma (後慶留間) 16.74 924 Shimajiri District Village Town mergers[edit] Main article: List of mergers in Okinawa Prefecture Natural parks[edit] As of 31 March 2019, 36 percent of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely the Iriomote-Ishigaki, Kerama Shotō, and Yanbaru National Parks; Okinawa Kaigan and Okinawa Senseki Quasi-National Parks; and Irabu, Kumejima, Tarama, and Tonaki Prefectural Natural Parks.[67] Fauna[edit] The dugong is an endangered marine mammal related to the manatee.[68] Iriomote is home to one of the world's rarest and most endangered cat species, the Iriomote cat. The region is also home to at least one endemic pit viper, Trimeresurus elegans. Coral reefs found in this region of Japan provide an environment for a diverse marine fauna. The sea turtles return yearly to the southern islands of Okinawa to lay their eggs. The summer months carry warnings to swimmers regarding venomous jellyfish and other dangerous sea creatures. Flora[edit] Okinawa is a major producer of sugar cane, pineapple, papaya, and other tropical fruit, and the Southeast Botanical Gardens represent tropical plant species. Arch at an Okinawan Castle ruin. Shuri Castle, Naha Geology[edit] The island is largely composed of coral, and rainwater filtering through that coral has given the island many caves, which played an important role in the Battle of Okinawa. Gyokusendo[69] is an extensive limestone cave in the southern part of Okinawa's main island. Climate[edit] The island experiences temperatures above 20 °C (68 °F) for most of the year. The climate of the islands ranges from humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa) in the north, such as Okinawa Island, to tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification Af) in the south such as Iriomote Island. The islands of Okinawa are surrounded by some of the most abundant coral reefs found in the world.[70][71] The world's largest colony of rare blue coral is found off of Ishigaki Island.[72] Snowfall is unheard of at sea level. However, on January 24, 2016, sleet was reported in Nago on Okinawa Island for the first time on record.[73] Demography[edit] Ethnic groups[edit] Although unrecognized by the Japanese government, the indigenous Ryukyuan people make up the majority of Okinawa Prefecture's population. Ryukyuans are also the main ethnic group of the Amami Islands to the north, and large Okinawan diaspora communities persist in places such as South America[74] and Hawaii.[75] With the introduction of American military bases, there are an increasing number of half-American children in Okinawa, including prefecture governor Denny Tamaki.[76] There is also a sizable mainland Japanese minority in the prefecture. The overall ethnic identity of Okinawa residents are rather split.

Language[edit] Main article: Ryukyuan languages There remain six Ryukyuan languages which, although related, are incomprehensible to speakers of Japanese. One of the Ryukyuan languages is spoken in Kagoshima Prefecture, rather than in Okinawa Prefecture. These languages are in decline as the younger generation of Okinawans uses Standard Japanese. Mainland Japanese - and some Okinawans themselves - generally perceive the Ryukyuan languages as "dialects". Standard Japanese is almost always used in formal situations. In informal situations, de facto everyday language among Okinawans under age 60 is Okinawa-accented mainland Japanese ("Okinawan Japanese"), which is often misunderstood[by whom?] as the Okinawan language proper. The actual traditional Okinawan language is still used in traditional cultural activities, such as folk music and folk dance. There is a radio-news program in the language as well.[80] Religion[edit] Main article: Ryukyuan religion Okinawans have traditionally followed Ryukyuan religious beliefs, generally characterized by ancestor worship and the respecting of relationships between the living, the dead, and the gods and spirits of the natural world.[81] Cultural influences[edit] Okinawan culture bears traces of its various trading partners. One can find Chinese, Thai and Austronesian influences in the island's customs. Perhaps Okinawa's most famous cultural export is karate, probably a product of the close ties with and influence of China on Okinawan culture. Karate is thought to be a synthesis of Chinese kung fu with traditional Okinawan martial arts. A traditional Okinawan product that owes its existence to Okinawa's trading history is awamori—an Okinawan distilled spirit made from indica rice imported from Thailand. Other cultural characteristics[edit] Other prominent examples of Okinawan culture include the sanshin—a three-stringed Okinawan instrument, closely related to the Chinese sanxian, and ancestor of the Japanese shamisen, somewhat similar to a banjo. Its body is often bound with snakeskin (from pythons, imported from elsewhere in Asia, rather than from Okinawa's venomous Trimeresurus flavoviridis, which are too small for this purpose). Okinawan culture also features the eisa dance, a traditional drumming dance. A traditional craft, the fabric named bingata, is made in workshops on the main island and elsewhere.[citation needed] The Okinawan diet consist of low-fat, low-salt foods, such as whole fruits and vegetables, legumes, tofu, and seaweed. They are particularly well known for consuming purple potatoes, aka, the okinawan sweet potatoes.[82] Okinawans are known for their longevity. This particular island is a so-called Blue Zone, an area where the people live longer than most others elsewhere in the world. Five times as many Okinawans live to be 100 as in the rest of Japan, and Japanese are already the longest-lived ethnic group globally.[83] As of 2002[update] there were 34.7 centenarians for every 100,000 inhabitants, which is the highest ratio worldwide.[84]:131–132 Possible explanations are diet, low-stress lifestyle, caring community, activity, and spirituality of the inhabitants of the island.[84][page needed] A cultural feature of the Okinawans is the forming of moais. A moai is a community social gathering and groups that come together to provide financial and emotional support through emotional bonding, advice giving, and social funding. This provides a sense of security for the community members and as mentioned in the Blue Zone studies, may be a contributing factor to the longevity of its people.[85] In recent years,[when?] Okinawan literature has been appreciated outside of the Ryukyu archipelago. Two Okinawan writers have received the Akutagawa Prize: Matayoshi Eiki in 1995 for The Pig's Retribution (豚の報い, Buta no mukui) and Medoruma Shun in 1997 for A Drop of Water (Suiteki). The prize was also won by Okinawans in 1967 by Tatsuhiro Oshiro for Cocktail Party (Kakuteru Pāti) and in 1971 by Mineo Higashi for Okinawan Boy (Okinawa no Shōnen).[86][87] Karate[edit] Main article: Karate Karate originated in Okinawa. Over time, it developed into several styles and sub-styles. On Okinawa, the three main styles are considered to be Shōrin-ryū, Gōjū-ryū and Uechi-ryū. Internationally, the various styles and sub-styles include Matsubayashi-ryū, Wadō-ryū, Isshin-ryū, Shōrinkan, Shotokan, Shitō-ryū, Shōrinjiryū Kenkōkan, Shorinjiryu Koshinkai, and Shōrinji-ryū. Architecture[edit] Nakamura house Shuri Castle in Naha Despite widespread destruction during World War II, there are many remains of a unique type of castle or fortress known as gusuku; the most significant are now inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List (Gusuku Sites and Related Properties of the Kingdom of Ryukyu).[88] In addition, twenty-three Ryukyuan architectural complexes and forty historic sites have been designated for protection by the national government.[89] Shuri Castle in Naha is an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Whereas most homes in Japan are made from wood and allow free-flow of air to combat humidity, typical modern homes in Okinawa are made from concrete with barred windows to protect from flying plant debris and to withstand regular typhoons. Roofs are designed with strong winds in mind, in which each tile is cemented on and not merely layered as seen with many homes in Japan.[citation needed] The Nakamura House (ja:中村家住宅 (沖縄県)) is an original 18th century farmhouse in Kitanakagusuki. Many roofs also display a lion-dog statue, called a shisa, which is said to protect the home from danger. Roofs are typically red in color and are inspired by Chinese design.[citation needed] Education[edit] The public schools in Okinawa are overseen by the Okinawa Prefectural Board of Education. The agency directly operates several public high schools[90] including Okinawa Shogaku High School. The U.S. Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DoDDS) operates 13 schools total in Okinawa. Seven of these schools are located on Kadena Air Base. Okinawa has many types of private schools. Some of them are cram schools, also known as juku. Others, such as Nova, solely teach language. People also attend small language schools.[91][citation needed] There are 10 colleges/universities in Okinawa, including the University of the Ryukyus, the only national university in the prefecture, and the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, a new international research institute. Okinawa's American military bases also host the Asian Division of the University of Maryland University College. Sports[edit] Association football FC Ryukyu (Naha) Basketball Ryukyu Golden Kings (Naha) Handball Ryukyu Corazon[92] (Naha) Baseball Announced on July 18, 2019, BASE Okinawa Baseball Club will be forming the first-ever professional baseball team on Okinawa, the Ryukyu Blue Oceans. The team is expected to be fully organized by January 2020 and intends on joining the Nippon Professional Baseball league.[93] In addition, various baseball teams from Japan hold training during the winter in Okinawa prefecture as it is the warmest prefecture of Japan with no snow and higher temperatures than other prefectures. Softbank Hawks Yokohama BayStars Chunichi Dragons Yakult Swallows Golf There are numerous golf courses in the prefecture, and there was formerly a professional tournament called the Okinawa Open.
