He was born in 1977 and died in June 1995.[2] He was a Vancouver Island wolf-Alaskan Malamute hybrid.[3] Jed was born at Whatcom Humane Society in Bellingham, Washington where Gerhardt "Gary" Winkler (Henry Winkler's second cousin) adopted him as part of his collection of Siberian Huskies and Alaskan Malamutes. His first role was a brief one as a Norwegian dog in John Carpenter's The Thing (1982). The character he played in the film was the first form to be taken by a shapeshifting alien creature; some scenes required him to behave in an unsettling and unnatural way. Jed's performance in The Thing has been lauded by the many fans of the movie. His next film appearance would be in Disney's The Journey of Natty Gann. In 1991, Jed starred as Jack London's titular character White Fang in the Walt Disney film of the same name, starring a young Ethan Hawke. Jed was trained by Clint Rowe,[3] who was involved in the films that Jed was cast in and was also associated with the film Turner and Hooch.[4] After filming Disney's sequel to "White Fang", Utah's Wild Bunch Ranch owner Jean M. Simpson and the producers retired Jed back to Clint Rowe's animal sanctuary in Acton, California. Jed remained there until his death in June 1995. His shrouded carcass was sent to Bellingham, Washington for interment at Gary Winkler's mixed dog breed sanctuary through a small private plane.
