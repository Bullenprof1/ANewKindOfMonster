One Story tells that a woman dressed in black appears walking along the rooms.[120] Taiwan[edit] Chiayi Min-Hsiung Haunted House: Located in Chiayi City, it was once the residence of the Liu family. It is probably one of the most recognized haunted house in Taiwan.[121] Grand Hyatt Taipei: The hotel that is located in Xinyi District, Taipei was believed to be haunted. The site of the hotel was believed by the locals to be a former Japanese concentration camp and believed to be haunted by former prisoners. It was believed that two big talisman-like paintings in the lobby was displayed on purpose to calm the spirits[122][123] United Arab Emirates[edit] Al Jazirah Al Hamra: An abandoned fishing village near Ras al-Khaimah which is believed to be haunted by the presence of supernatural jinns.[124][125][126] United Kingdom[edit] Main article: Reportedly haunted locations in the United Kingdom The United Kingdom is reputedly the most haunted landmass in the world, with England as the most haunted country, reporting the densest coverage of purported ghost sightings and paranormal experiences both per person, and by geographical area.[127] Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland are also rich in ghost lore (though far less densely populated), and there is not a single village, town or city which does not have reportings of ghosts and ghost belief going back multiple centuries.[128] United States[edit] Main article: List of reportedly haunted locations in the United States The Octagon in Washington, D.C. (left), and Winchester Mystery House in California (right) Many sites in the United States are reputedly haunted, including: Dudleytown, Connecticut; the Cherry Hill Estate and 112 Ocean Avenue House (a.k.a. the Amityville Horror House) in New York; several areas in Williamsburg, Virginia; several buildings in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the Octagon House and the White House in Washington, D.C.; the Peoria State Hospital in Bartonville, Illinois; and El Adobe de Capistrano in California. Vietnam[edit] 300 Kim Mã in Hanoi is a building which was proposed to be the Bulgarian Embassy in Vietnam, but was abandoned for an unknown reason. After a murder near this building, the story of mysterious phenomenas including the ghost of a Western man is popularised across the nation. Now it is the property of Vietnamese government.[129] Côn Đảo: The unfinished stone bridge in the deep jungle named "Ma Thiên Lãnh Bridge" is called by the locals "Ghost Bridge", which is a bridge built by over 300 prisoners who suffered immensely and died under French control. One villager saw a long haired male ghost in a white shirt and black pants watch him while he was drinking with a friend, and then disappear. Another female villager said she saw a woman wearing a white dress standing on a bridge alone at the dawn, who she instantly recognized as a hungry ghost. Another woman says she came across the ghosts of two boys without a shirt, who forced her to give them dessert.[130] The Hui Mansion (now Ho Chi Minh City Museum of Fine Arts): One of the most mysterious places in Ho Chi Minh City, located at 97 Phó Đức Chính Street, District 1. People believe that the mansion is haunted by the ghost of Mr. Hui Bon Hoa's leprosy daughter.[25][131] See also[edit] See also: Category:Reportedly haunted locations Ghost hunting Haunted house List of ghosts List of ghost films List of Ghost Adventures episodes (includes lists of reportedly haunted locations mostly in the United States that have been investigated) List of Ghost Hunters episodes (includes lists of reportedly haunted locations in the United States that have been investigated) List of Most Haunted episodes (includes lists of reportedly haunted locations in the United Kingdom and Ireland that have been investigated) References[edit] ^ "Polémica por una momia de Cinco Saltos".
