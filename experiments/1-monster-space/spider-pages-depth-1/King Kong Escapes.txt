Mechani-Kong enters an ice cave and begins to dig into a glacier, but the radiation destroys its brain circuits and the robot shuts down. Who then sets his sights on getting the real Kong to finish the job. Who is taken to task by a female overseer, Madame Piranha, whose country's government is financing the doctor's schemes, and frequently berates him for his failure to get results. Meanwhile, a submarine commanded by Carl Nelson arrives at Mondo Island, where the legendary King Kong lives. Here, the giant ape gets into an intense fight with a giant dinosaur Gorosaurus and a sea serpent. He falls in love with Lt. Susan Watson (played by Linda Jo Miller) following in the footsteps of Ann Darrow from the 1933 film. Dr. Who subsequently goes to Mondo Island, abducts Kong and brings him back to his base at the North Pole. Kong is hypnotized by a flashing light device and fitted with a radio earpiece. Who commands Kong to retrieve Element X from the cave. Problems with the earpiece ensue and Who has to kidnap Susan Watson, the only person who can control Kong. After Watson and her fellow officers are captured by Who, Madame Piranha unsuccessfully tries to seduce Nelson to bring him over to her side. Eventually Kong escapes and swims all the way to Japan where the climactic battle with Mechani-Kong transpires. The two giants face off at the Tokyo Tower in the finale. Kong prevails and destroys Mechani-Kong and kills Who. Then Kong triumphantly swims back to his island home. Cast[edit] Rhodes Reason - Commander Carl Nelson (Japanese voice actor: Kei Taguchi) Akira Takarada - Lt. Commander Jiro Nomura　 Linda Jo Miller - Lt. Susan Watson (Japanese voice actor: Akiko Santou; English (redubbed) voice actor: Julie Bennett) Hideyo Amamoto - Dr. Who[1][2][3] (English voice actor: Paul Frees) Mie Hama - Madame Piranha (English voice actor: Julie Bennett) Yoshifumi Tajima - Chief Nadao Kirino - Dr. Who's assistant Shoichi Hirose, Toru Ibuki, Nadao Kirino, Susumu Kurobe, Sachio Sakai, Kazuo Suzuki, Yoshifumi Tajima - Dr Who Henchman Andrew Hughes - United Nations journalist Ryūji Kita - Police inspector Masaaki Tachibana - Self-Defense Force soldier Ikio Sawamura - Mondo Islander Yasuhisa Tsutsumi - General Osman Yusuf - Submariner Haruo Nakajima - King Kong Yū Sekida - Mechani-Kong and Gorosaurus Production[edit] The story is partly a remake of the animated TV series[4] (itself a retelling of the original 1933 film) about a tamed Kong who is befriended by a boy and directed to fight for the forces of good. That concept (minus the boy) is combined with a mad scientist story with elements from the then-popular spy film genre. The sinister Dr. Who (not to be confused with the British television series, its main character or his film version) is patterned after James Bond villains Dr. Julius No and Ernst Stavro Blofeld[citation needed]. His partner, Madame Piranha, is an Asian spy played by Mie Hama, fresh from the Bond film You Only Live Twice (1967). Submarine commander Carl Nelson is similar to Admiral Nelson, commander of the submarine Seaview in Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea[citation needed], a series that also featured giant monsters and stories about international espionage. Veteran voice actor Paul Frees dubbed the voice of Dr. Who in the American version. In an interview with Reason on the making of this film, Paul Frees did almost all the male voices for the dubbed version. Frees apparently asked Reason why he was there and said as a joke: "Why are you here? I could probably do a better version of you than you could.".[5] Linda Miller hated her dubbed voice in the American version, but loved the Japanese voice. She was extremely mad at Mr. Rankin, the producer, for not inviting her to dub her own lines when Rhodes Reason (Nelson) was able to re-dub his.[6] It turned out to work this way because Reason was a part of the Screen Actors Guild, and Linda Miller was only a model, and still residing in Japan at the time (transportation costs to New York would have been prohibitive).[6] The shot of Gorosaurus living on Monster Island seen in the 1969 film All Monsters Attack was actually stock footage taken from this film.[7] Effects[edit] Eiji Tsuburaya - Special effects director Sadamasa Arikawa - Secondary special effects director Teruyoshi Nakano - Assistant special effects director Takeo Kita - Art direction Fumio Nakadai - Wireworks director Yasuyuki Inoue - Special effects sets Release[edit] Theatrical[edit] Japanese theatrical release poster for the 1973 re-release of the film Toho re-released the film in 1973[8] as part of the Champion Matsuri (東宝チャンピオンまつり), a film festival that ran from 1969 through 1978 and featured numerous films packaged together and aimed at children.[9] Afterwards it was screened as part of a specialty festival in 1983 called The Godzilla Resurrection Festival (Gojira no Fukkatsu). This large festival featured 10 Godzilla/kaiju films in all (Godzilla, King Kong vs. Godzilla, Mothra vs. Godzilla, Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster, Invasion of Astro-Monster, Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla, Rodan, Mothra, Atragon, and King Kong Escapes).[10] Outside Japan and the U.S, the film received a wide release in most international markets, where it went by different titles. The film was released in Germany as King-Kong, Frankensteins Sohn (King Kong: Frankenstein's Son), in Belgium as La Revanche de King Kong (The Revenge of King Kong) - a direct translation of the Japanese title, in Italy as King Kong il gigante della foresta (King Kong, the Giant of the Forest), in Turkey as Canavarlarin Gazabi (Wrath of the Monsters), in Mexico as El Regreso de King Kong (The Return of King Kong), in Finland as King Kong kauhun saarella (King Kong on the Island of Terror), and in Sweden as King Kong på skräckens ö (King Kong on Terror Island)[11][12] Home media[edit] DVD R1 America - Universal Pictures[13] Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (Anamorphic) [NTSC] Soundtrack(s): English Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono Subtitles: English, French and Spanish Case type: Keep case Release date: November 29, 2005 Notes: Also available in a double feature two-pack (separate keep cases) with King Kong vs. Godzilla Blu-ray Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (High-Def Widescreen) Soundtrack(s): English DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 Mono Subtitles: English SDH, Francais Release date: April 1, 2014[14] Reception[edit] Box office[edit] The film opened in the United States in June 1968 as a double feature with the Don Knotts comedy film The Shakiest Gun in the West (a remake of the 1948 Bob Hope comedy film The Paleface). The film earned American and Canadian theatrical rentals of $1 million,[15] equivalent to estimated box office gross receipts of approximately $3 million.[16] In France, the film sold 1,014,593 tickets.[17] Critical response[edit] Contemporary American reviews were mixed. New York Times film critic Vincent Canby gave it a particularly insulting review, commenting, "The Japanese ... are all thumbs when it comes to making monster movies like 'King Kong Escapes.' The Toho moviemakers are quite good in building miniature sets, but much of the process photography—matching the miniatures with the full-scale shots—is just bad ... the plotting is hopelessly primitive ..." The July 15, 1968, issue of Film Bulletin, however, gave it a more positive review, saying, "Grown-ups who like their entertainments on a comic-strip level will find this good fun and the Universal release (made in Japan) has plenty of ballyhoo angles to draw the school-free youngsters in large numbers." Legacy[edit] "Gorilla" battles the Toho superhero Greenman from an episode of the 1973 series Go! Greenman. "Gorilla" was portrayed by the King Kong suit from this film. Toho wanted to use King Kong again after this film. King Kong was included in an early draft for the 1968 film Destroy All Monsters[18] but was ultimately dropped due to the fact that Toho's license on the character was set to expire. Toho managed to get some use out of the suit, though. The suit was reused to play the character "Gorilla" in episode #38 of the Toho giant superhero show Go! Greenman. The three-part episode, titled "Greenman vs. Gorilla", aired from March 21, 1974 through March 23, 1974.[19] Toho would bring the character Gorosaurus into the Godzilla series in Destroy All Monsters, using the same suit from this film. The suit was reused again four years later (at this point in a dilapidated condition) to portray the character in episode #6 of the Toho giant superhero show Go! Godman. The six-part episode, titled "Godman vs. Gorosaurus", aired from November 9, 1972 through November 15, 1972.[20] In the early 1990s when plans for a King Kong vs. Godzilla remake fell through, Toho had planned to bring back Mechani-Kong as an opponent for Godzilla in the project Godzilla vs. Mechani-Kong. However, according to Koichi Kawakita, it was discovered that obtaining permission to use even the likeness of King Kong would be difficult. Kawakita stated: Toho wanted to pit Godzilla against King Kong because King Kong vs. Godzilla was very successful. However, the studio thought that obtaining permission to use King Kong would be difficult. So, it instead decided to use MechaniKong. Soon afterward, it was discovered that obtaining permission even to use the likeness of King Kong would be difficult. So, the project was canceled. MechaniKong was going to have injectors. A number of people were going to be injected into Godzilla while the robot was wrestling with him. They then were going to do battle with Godzilla from within while MechaniKong continued to do battle with him from without. There were going to be many different strange worlds inside Godzilla. The concept was very much like the one on which Fantastic Voyage was based.[21][22] References[edit] Notes ^ Ragone, August (2007). Eiji Tsuburaya: Master of Monsters.
