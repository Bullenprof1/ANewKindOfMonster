10-character alphanumeric unique identifier "ASIN" redirects here. For other uses, see ASIN (disambiguation). An Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) is a 10-character alphanumeric unique identifier assigned by Amazon.com and its partners for product identification within the Amazon organization.[1] Usage and structure[edit] Each product sold on Amazon.com is given a unique ASIN. For books with 10-digit International Standard Book Number (ISBN), the ASIN and the ISBN are the same.[2] The Kindle edition of a book will not use its ISBN as the ASIN, although the electronic version of a book may have its own ISBN. The ASIN forms part of the URL of a product detail page on Amazon's website.[3] References[edit] ^ "Amazon.ca Help: Product Identifiers". Amazon.ca.
