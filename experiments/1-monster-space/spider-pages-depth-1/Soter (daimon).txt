For other uses, see Soter. In Greek mythology, Soter (Σωτήρ "Saviour, Deliverer") was the personification or daimon of safety, preservation and deliverance from harm.[1] Suidas makes him the brother and husband of Praxidike and by her the father of Ktesios, Arete and Homonoia.[2] (Note that both Soter and Ktesios were also cult titles of Zeus). In the Orphic Hymns[3] Praxidike was identified with Persephone, Soter with Zeus, and their daughters Praxidikai with the Erinyes. Aeschylus references Soter as the husband of Peitharchia and father of Eupraxia.[4] Soteria (Σωτηρία), personification of the abstract concept of safety and salvation, was also worshipped by the Greeks. She had a sanctuary in Patrae, which was believed to have been founded by Eurypylos of Thessaly.[5] References[edit] ^ Theoi Project - Soter ^ Suidas s.v.
