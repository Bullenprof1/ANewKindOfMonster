On the coast of Elis, not far from the mouth of the river, there was a grotto sacred to them near modern Samiko, which was visited by persons afflicted with skin diseases.[1] They were supposedly cured here by prayers and sacrifices to the nymphs, and by bathing in the river.[2][3][4] The earliest known attestation of the cult of these nymphs was from the poet Moero in the 3rd century BCE.[5] The river Anigrus (or Anigros) itself was a small stream in southern Elis that flowed down from Mount Lapithas and the mountains at Minthi to the Ionian Sea. The waters are distinctly sulfuric in character.[5] The river and cave are now part of the thermal springs of Kaiafas.[6] Notes[edit] ^ Lambrakis, Nicolaos; Katsanou, Konstantina (2014), "Geothermal fields and thermal waters of Greece: an overview", in Baba, Alper; Bundschuh, Jochen (eds.), Geothermal Systems and Energy Resources: Turkey and Greece, Sustainable Energy Developments, CRC Press, p. 25, ISBN 978-1138001091, retrieved 2015-12-21 ^ Pausanias, Description of Greece v. 5. § 6 ^ Strabo, viii. p. 346 ^ Eustathius of Thessalonica, On Homer p. 880. ^ a b Larson, Jennifer Lynn (2001).
