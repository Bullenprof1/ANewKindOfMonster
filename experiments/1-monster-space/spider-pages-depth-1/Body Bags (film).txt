It is notable for its numerous celebrity cameo appearances. The first story, "The Gas Station", features Robert Carradine as a serial killer, with cameos by David Naughton, Sam Raimi, and Wes Craven. "Hair" follows Stacy Keach as he receives a botched hair transplant that infests him with an alien parasite. "Eye" features Mark Hamill as a baseball player who loses an eye in a car accident and receives a transplant, only to be taken over by the personality of the eye's previous owner, a murderous killer.

"The Gas Station"[edit] Anne is a young college student who arrives for her first job working the night shift at an all-night filling station near Haddonfield, Illinois (a reference to the setting of Carpenter's two Halloween films). The leaving worker, Bill, reminds her that a serial killer has broken out of a mental hospital, and cautions her not to leave the booth at the station without the keys because the door locks automatically. After Bill leaves, Anne is alone and the tension mounts as she deals with various late-night customers seeking to buy gas for a quick fill-up, purchase cigarettes or just use the restroom key, unsure whether any of them might be the escaped maniac. A homeless transient asks to use the restroom, and when a partying couple arrives, she asks the man to check on the bum. He says he is sleeping. After the couple leaves, Annie goes inside the men's restroom, only to find an elaborately grotesque drawing on an evil looking entity carrying beheaded people in the restroom and then the dead body of the homeless man sitting in a pickup truck on the lift in one of the garage bays. She makes a phone call for help which results in her realization that "Bill", the attending worker she met earlier, is in fact the escaped killer, who has killed the real Bill and is killing numerous passers-by. She finds the real Bill's dead body in one of the lockers. Serial killer "Bill" then reappears and attempts to kill Anne with a machete, breaking into the locked booth by smashing out the glass with a sledgehammer and then chasing her around the deserted garage. Just as he is about to kill her, a customer named Pete returns, having forgotten his credit card, and he wrestles the killer, giving Anne time to crush the maniac under the vehicle lift. "Hair"[edit] Richard Coberts is a middle-aged businessman who is very self-conscious about his thinning hair. This obsession has caused a rift between him and his long-suffering girlfriend Megan. Richard answers a television ad about a "miracle" hair transplant procedure, pays a visit to the office, and meets the shady Dr. Lock, who agrees to give Richard a solution to make his hair grow back. The next day, Richard wakes up and removes the bandage around his head, and is overjoyed to find that he has a full head of hair. But soon he becomes increasingly sick and fatigued, and finds his hair continuing to grow and, additionally, growing out of parts of his body, where hair does not normally grow. Trying to cut a hair off his mouth, he finds that it "screams", and, examining it under a magnifying glass, sees that it's alive and resembles a tiny serpent. He goes back to Dr. Lock for an explanation, but finds himself a prisoner as Dr. Lock explains that he and his entire staff are aliens from another planet, seeking out narcissistic human beings and planting seeds of "hair" to take over their bodies for consumption as part of their plan to spread their essence to Earth. Soon after this reveal, according to the coroner, he jumps off of the building on top of a moving car and then dragged by a moving train. "Eye"[edit] Brent Matthews is a baseball player whose life and career take a turn for the worse when he gets into a serious car accident in which his right eye is damaged. Unwilling to admit that his career is over, he jumps at the chance to undergo an experimental surgical procedure to replace his eye with one from a recently deceased person. But soon after the surgery he begins to see things out of his new eye that others cannot see, and begins having nightmares of killing women and having sex with them. Brent seeks out the doctor who operated on him, and the doctor tells him that the donor of his new eye was John Randle, a recently executed serial killer and necrophile who killed several young women, and then had sex with their dead bodies. Brent becomes convinced that the spirit of the dead killer is taking over his body so that he can resume killing women. He flees back to his house and tells his skeptical wife, Cathy, about what is happening. Just then the spirit of the killer emerges and attempts to kill Cathy as well. Cathy fights back, subduing him long enough for Brent to re-emerge. Realizing that it is only a matter of time before the killer emerges again, Brent stabs his donated eye with garden scissors, severing his link with the killer, but then bleeds to death. Epilogue The coroner is finishing telling his last tale when he hears a noise from outside the morgue. He crawls back inside a body bag, revealing that he himself is a living cadaver. The noise is shown to be the walking of two other morgue workers; soon they begin to go to work on his "John Doe" corpse.

Soundtrack[edit] Main article: Body Bags (soundtrack) Critical reception[edit] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (February 2016) Body Bags was generally well received by critics and holds a 67% approval rating on movie review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 12 reviews with an average score of 5.56/10.[2] However, Time Out (London, UK) called the film "an attempt by a pair of one-time horror auteurs to emulate the successful Tales from the Crypt formula, only now it's nowhere near as happening."[3] See also[edit] Nightmares - a 1983 anthology film with television roots.
