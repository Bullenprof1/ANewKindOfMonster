Philomelus /ˌfɪləˈmiːləs/ (Greek: Φιλόμηλος, romanized: Philómēlos) or Philomenus /fɪˈlɒmɪnəs/ was a minor Greek demi-god, patron of Husbandry, Tillage/Ploughing and Agriculture, the son of Demeter and Iasion, and the brother of Plutus. Plutus was very wealthy, but would share none of his riches to his brother. Out of necessity, Philomenus bought two oxen, invented the wagon or plough, and supported himself by ploughing his fields and cultivating crops. His mother, admiring him for this, put him in the heavens as the constellation Boötes, his wagon or plough being the constellation Ursa Major. Philomelus's son Parias gave his name to the Parians and the city of Parion (a town in Mysia on the Hellespont).[1] References[edit] ^ Hyginus. Astronomica, 2.4.7.
