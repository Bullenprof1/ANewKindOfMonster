Although the subgenre is often overlooked by critics, parody films are commonly profitable at the box office.[4] Contents 1 Examples 1.1 1900s 1.2 1910s 1.3 1920s 1.4 1930s 1.5 1940s 1.6 1950s 1.7 1960s 1.8 1970s 1.9 1980s 1.10 1990s 1.11 2000s 1.12 2010s 1.13 2020s 2 References Examples[edit] 1900s[edit] Sherlock Holmes Baffled (1900) The Little Train Robbery (1905) 1910s[edit] The Mystery of the Leaping Fish (1916) Teddy at the Throttle (1917) 1920s[edit] Mud and Sand (1922) Three Ages (1923) Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pryde (1925) Yes, Yes, Nanette (1925) 1930s[edit] Free and Easy (1930) Movie Crazy (1932) Number Seventeen (1932) Once in a Lifetime (1932) Sons of the Desert (1933) Babes in Toyland (1934) Satan Met a Lady (1936) The Man Who Was Sherlock Holmes (1937) Ali Baba Goes to Town (1937) 1940s[edit] The Great Profile (1940) You Nazty Spy!
