Inachus, p. 318; Grimal, s.v. Inachus, p. 230; Apollodorus, 2.1.1. Compare with Ovid, Amores 3.6.25–26, which perhaps confuses or conflates this Melia with the Bithynian Melia, who was the mother of Amycus and Mygdon by Poseidon. ^ Hyginus, Fabulae 143 (Smith and Trzaskoma, p. 147). ^ Larson, p. 149; Hard, p. 227; Gantz, p. 198. ^ Fowler, p. 236; Nostoi fr. 8* (West, pp. 160, 161) = Scholiast on the Odyssey 2.120; compare with Pausanias, 2.16.4, which, citing the Megalai Ehoiai, says that Mycene was the daughter of Inachus and the wife of Arestor, without naming the mother.
