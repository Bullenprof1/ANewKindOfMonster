"After six months," he said, "I realized that I was an actor and I would always be an actor. And an actor must act. So I started acting again."[4] His first acting job in the United States was in Princeton, New Jersey. He worked as a carpenter, and his wife took in ironing in order to supplement his $25 per week pay.[2] He joined APA (The Association of Producing Artists), a repertory company on Broadway, and was nominated for a Tony for Best Actor in a Play in 1967 for his roles in revivals of Henrik Ibsen's The Wild Duck and Pirandello's Right You Are If You Think You Are.[5] He was nominated for Drama Desk Awards for Outstanding Actor in a Play for his work in Play Memory (1984) and for Outstanding Featured Actor in the revival of Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh (1986) with Jason Robards.[6] He won an Obie for Painting Churches.[7] In 1998, he was nominated for a Gemini Award for his performance as attorney Joe Ruah in the CBC miniseries The Sleep Room.[8] He also appeared in many Broadway and Off-Broadway plays, including John Guare's A Few Stout Individuals (as Ulysses S. Grant),[9] The Heiress,[10] The Cherry Orchard,[11] Much Ado About Nothing,[12] The School for Scandal,[12] The Affair[13] and Hamlet.[14] Film[edit] Among Moffat's best-known film roles are as Lyndon B.
