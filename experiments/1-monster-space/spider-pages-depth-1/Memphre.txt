It was formed by melting glaciers 10,000 years ago, during the last ice-age. The lake freezes over each winter, often becoming up to a metre (three feet) thick. History[edit] Memphre is often described as much like the Loch Ness Monster. While the existence of Memphre and most other lake monsters is treated skeptically by the scientific community, reports of sightings persist, with the last in 2005.[1] Coin[edit] In August 2011, an artistic impression of Memphre was featured on a coloured Canadian quarter.[2][3] See also[edit] Ogopogo, reported to live in Okanagan Lake, in British Columbia, Canada Manipogo, said to live in Lake Manitoba, Manitoba Champ, reported to live in Lake Champlain, between New York, Vermont and Quebec Seelkee, said to live in the swamps of what is now Chilliwack, in British Columbia References[edit] ^ "Lake Memphremagog monster (Memphre) | The World of Animals". theworldofanimals.proboards.com.
