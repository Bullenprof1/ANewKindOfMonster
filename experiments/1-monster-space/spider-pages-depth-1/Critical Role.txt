The show started streaming partway through the cast's first campaign in March 2015. Campaign one ended in October 2017 after 115 episodes, and campaign two, which is still ongoing, started in January 2018. A number of one-shots were aired in the hiatus between the two campaigns. The series is broadcast on Thursdays at 19:00 PT on the Critical Role Twitch channel, with the video on demand (VOD) being available to Twitch subscribers immediately after the broadcast. The VODs are made available for the public on Critical Role's website and uploaded to their YouTube channel on the Monday after the live stream. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the show had broadcast live, but has been pre-recorded since its return for episode 100 of Campaign Two. The cast own the intellectual property from the show, and the show also lends its name to the studio owned by the cast—Critical Role Productions. The studio has produced Critical Role and Talks Machina since 2018. A number of licensed works based on the show have been released, such as several comic books and two official campaign setting guides.

Critical Role company and studio[edit] Main article: Critical Role Productions The Critical Role company, Critical Role Productions LLC, was incorporated in 2015.[15] As of 2019[update], Travis Willingham serves as chief executive officer,[3] Matthew Mercer as chief creative officer,[16] Marisha Ray as creative director,[17] Ed Lopez as chief operating officer,[16] Rachel Romero as senior vice president of marketing,[16] and Ben Van Der Fluit as vice president of business development.[16] In June 2018, Critical Role Productions launched its own Twitch and YouTube channels, with cast member Marisha Ray being announced as the creative director of the franchise.[18] It also moved to their own studio space in 2018 and started putting out new shows on their own Twitch and YouTube channels.[2][19][18][20] The sets for Critical Role and Talks Machina moved from Legendary Digital Network's studios to Critical Role's own studios in July 2018.[2] In February 2019, Critical Role finalized its split from Geek & Sundry and Legendary Digital Networks, with live broadcasts of the company's shows and VODs airing exclusively on Critical Role's channels.[21] Critical Role also took over production responsibility for Critical Role and Talks Machina after splitting from Legendary Digital Networks.[4][22] Some "legacy episodes" (currently the entirety of Campaign 1, the first 19 episodes of Campaign 2, as well as the corresponding episodes of official discussion show Talks Machina) remain available in Geek & Sundry's archives on YouTube and Twitch,[21] though some older episodes of Critical Role and Talks Machina are being deleted from the Geek and Sundry channels and re-uploaded to the official Critical Role channels since 2019 as part of an ongoing migration of older content to the creator-owned channels.[23]:0:45 Format[edit] Critical Role is a mixture of a weekly show and a modern gaming Twitch stream.[9] Each episode usually runs for three to five (in some cases six) hours and is streamed live on Critical Role's Twitch channel on almost every Thursday, with possible breaks from the show being announced at least one week prior to the broadcast.[24][25] The VOD is made available for subscribers of Critical Role's Twitch channel immediately after airing and before being uploaded to Critical Role's YouTube channel the following Monday, where it can be watched for free.[26][21] Critical Role has played with a live theater audience nine times.[27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35] A number of Critical Role's streams have also served as a donation drive to support nonprofit organizations such as St Jude, 826LA, Extra Life, and Doctors Without Borders.[36] Campaign structure[edit] Main article: List of Critical Role episodes The Critical Role storyline occurs in campaigns that consist of a series of story arcs, which are usually played over multiple episodes. Between—or sometimes within—the major story arcs, the characters rest, resupply, or go on side quests. In addition, every player character has a backstory, an unfinished part of their personal history that can be relevant to the campaign from time to time. Sometimes, major story arcs are intrinsically tied to a character's backstory. While each campaign centers on a different party of adventurers, both are set in Exandria, a world of Mercer's creation.[37] As of March 2021,[update] the cast of Critical Role are playing through their second campaign.

It follows the exploits of an adventuring party known as Vox Machina, previously known as the Super High-Intensity Team (or S.H.I.T.s), a rag-tag group of mercenaries originally formed in the swamp town of Stilben.[38] Pre-series history[edit] The Vox Machina campaign originated as the home game of the cast, played from 2012 to 2017. In their adventures prior to the start of the series, the group saved the family of Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei III, ruler of Tal'Dorei and its capital city of Emon. In appreciation, Uriel gave the group seats on the city council, and provided them with a residence called Greyskull Keep, which is located just outside the city. While the early adventures were not formally recorded, some shorter recordings have been released by the cast. This includes audio from the first session of the campaign, which was released as a segment in the third episode of the podcast All Work No Play.[39] Additionally, O'Brien released a recording of the magic carpet being discovered by the party.[40] Episode 36, titled Winter's Crest in Whitestone, features a summary of the pre-series history,[41] with artwork created by Wendy Sullivan Green and voice-overs provided by the cast.[42] The comic book, Critical Role: Vox Machina Origins, is an adaptation of the group's game before the show.[43] The upcoming animated series, The Legend of Vox Machina, will also include a canonic story that takes place within the pre-stream time frame.[44] On-stream campaign[edit] The show begins in media res with the characters regrouping in the city of Emon after approximately six months apart and the streamed campaign picks up where the cast's original home game left off. The first episode of the show aired on March 12, 2015, and the campaign concluded with its final episode on October 12, 2017.[11][45] Campaign one was broadcast live on the Geek & Sundry Twitch and YouTube channels between March 12, 2015, and October 12, 2017, for a total of 115 episodes and six story arcs.[26][13] Starting in November 2016, it was also broadcast live on the Alpha streaming service from Legendary Digital Networks. The show on Alpha had a unique overlay that included "real-time character sheets, damage and heal animations, and visualizations".[46] After the animated series, The Legend of Vox Machina, was picked up by Amazon and "Prime Video ordered an additional 14 episodes, for a total of 24 episodes across two seasons",[47] Critical Role announced that the animated show would adapt the full Briarwood arc along with other storylines from campaign one.[48] Post-campaign[edit] In 2019, over a year after the first campaign ended, Critical Role produced three canonical one-shot games that feature Vox Machina in the time frame after Vecna's banishment. The first one-shot, Vox Machina: The Search for Grog, was played at a live show in Los Angeles on January 19, 2019,[49] then broadcast on Twitch on February 22, 2019, before being released via YouTube and Twitch VOD on February 23, 2019.[50] It explored an event that took place in the final episode of campaign one, but was not played out in detail because it would have disrupted the ongoing epilogue. More Vox Machina one-shots were unlocked as rewards and stretch goals during the Kickstarter campaign for the Critical Role animated series. The first of these was Vox Machina: The Search for Bob,[51][52] a continuation of the events of The Search for Grog. It aired on the Critical Role Twitch channel on June 21, 2019, with the YouTube VOD being made available on June 23, 2019.[53] Another Kickstarter reward was Vox Machina's Summer Reunion at Dalen's Closet, which aired on Twitch on August 29, 2019, with the YouTube VOD becoming available for the public on September 2, 2019. This one-shot takes place a year after the events of The Search for Grog/Bob, as Percy and Vex renew their wedding vows on a beach in Marquet, with all of their friends and family present—as well as a few uninvited "guests".[54] Critical Role also played another canonical and Vox Machina-related one-shot at a live show in 2019: The Adventures of the Darrington Brigade, which was played at the Bass Concert Hall in Austin, Texas, on November 23, 2019. It stars Sam Riegel as Taryon Darrington, honorary member of Vox Machina, who leads a group of new characters into their own adventures. The story is set roughly a decade after campaign one and a decade before campaign two. It aired on the Critical Role Twitch channel on November 29, 2019, with the YouTube VOD being made available on December 1, 2019.[55][56] Campaign two[edit] Main article: Critical Role (campaign two) The second campaign began on January 11, 2018, and follows the adventuring party known as The Mighty Nein. The story is set on the continent of Wildemount, which was briefly visited during the Vox Machina campaign. The Mighty Nein campaign is set about 20 years after Vox Machina's final battle against Vecna and takes place in a time where tensions between two of Wildemount's mightiest nations are very high.[57][58] A hiatus due to concerns around the COVID-19 pandemic was in effect from March to July 2020, after which the show returned in a non-live format adjusted for social distancing.[59][60][61] One-shots[edit] Main article: List of Critical Role episodes § One-shots Instead of an episode in the main storyline, the series occasionally features a one-shot game—a self-contained story that can be told within the time constraints of one episode (or three to four hours of gameplay). A one-shot could be described as the RPG equivalent to a short story. Some of the Critical Role one-shots are canonical parts of the storylines that play out in one of the campaigns, covering events that occur outside the time frame of the respective campaign, but still feature some of the campaign's main characters. Other one-shots only have a tangential relationship to the campaigns, as they are set in the world of Exandria, but feature a different cast of characters, often in smaller scale adventures that may or may not be canon. There are also one-shots that have no connection with the campaigns or the world of Exandria at all.[62][63][64][65] Not all Critical Role one-shots use the Dungeons & Dragons game system, as some are based on other RPG systems. In many one-shots, other cast members take over the role of Dungeon Master or game master (GM) from Mercer.[66][65] The show aired several one-shots in the hiatus between campaign one and campaign two.[66][67] Some of Critical Role's one shots have been sponsored. One-shot sponsors have included Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, Blizzard Entertainment, and Chaosium for running one-shots themed around Middle-earth: Shadow of War, Hearthstone, and Call of Cthulhu respectively. In 2019, a Critical Role one-shot was sponsored by Wendy's to promote the Feast of Legends RPG system developed by the company.[68] However, following a strong negative fan response to the sponsor, the Critical Role team chose to take down the VOD,[68] and announced via Twitter that they had donated their sponsorship profits from the one-shot to the Farm Worker Justice organization.[69] Cast and characters[edit] Since October 2015,[update] Critical Role has consisted of eight main cast members, all of whom are the original cast. The show had a cast of nine for the first 27 episodes.[70] A number of guest players have also appeared on the show over the years.[71] Main[edit] The cast and their characters' names, races, and classes for the two campaigns are listed below. When a player has taken the option of multiclassing, the classes are listed in the order taken by the player. An H is used to indicate a homebrew class developed by Mercer.

Only a few guests (Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, Will Friedle and Patrick Rothfuss in campaign one, as well as Khary Payton in campaign two) have appeared in non-consecutive episodes, with their respective characters playing an active role in different parts of the overall storyline. So far, Chris Perkins is the only guest to have appeared in both campaigns, playing a different character for each campaign.[71] Actor Campaign 1 (2015–17) Campaign 2 (2018–current) Felicia Day Lyra (human wizard) N/A Mary Elizabeth McGlynn Zahra Hydris (tiefling warlock) N/A Wil Wheaton Thorbir Falbek (dwarf fighter) N/A Will Friedle Kashaw Vesh (human cleric) N/A Kit Buss Lillith Anioska Daturai (tiefling wizard) N/A Jason C.

Fans also send in many gifts for the cast and crew, resulting in occasional "Critmas" episodes during which the gifts are opened and distributed.[81] The cast of Critical Role are active participants on sci-fi/comics convention circuits, and have appeared for panels and signings at San Diego and New York Comic Cons.[8] For the 2015 New York con, "critical rolls" were available from one of the food vendors.[82] Andy Wilson, for Bleeding Cool, highlighted Critical Role as "the best show [he has] watched all year" in 2020. He wrote, "I've said repeatedly that Critical Role is the future of television, and specifically praising their response to COVID that continued their show in a safe way where no one has gotten sick. Let me pause there for a moment: no one has gotten sick. They have been smart and responsible and safe. [...] But even more important is what they did this year. They are, weekly, one of the most-watched streams on Twitch. [...] They gave fans something to look forward to every week– an incredible feat given the endless monotony and despair of socially distant quarantine life."[83] Accolades[edit] Year Award Category Result Ref 2016 Streamy Awards Gaming Nominated [84] 2018 Streamy Awards Live Streamer Nominated [85] 2019 Webby Awards Video Series & Channels – Games Won (Webby Award & People's Voice) [16] 2019 Shorty Awards Games Won (Finalist & Audience Honor) [86] Licensed works and related products[edit] There are a number of spin-off shows and books, all of which are produced by the Critical Role studio. Various third-party, licensed works have also been released since Critical Role began in 2015. Animated series[edit] On March 4, 2019, the cast launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for a 22-minute animation called Critical Role: The Legend of Vox Machina Animated Special.[87] The animated story will be set just before the streaming portion of the campaign started—when the players were around level seven—during a time when, canonically, there is an in-game period of roughly six months when the (then eight) members of Vox Machina were not all together at the same time. The cast projected a cost of US$750,000 for a single 22-minute animated short, fulfilling the other campaign rewards, and the fees associated with a crowdfunding campaign. Not knowing how long this would take to raise, the campaign length was set at 45 days.[88] Within an hour of launch, however, the Kickstarter had reached more than $1,000,000.[88] At the end of the first full day, all of the announced stretch goals had been unlocked, and the total had reached more than $4.3 million.[89] With four 22-minute episodes funded in the first 24 hours,[89] additional stretch goals were added, expanding the project into an animated series. The first two episodes would cover the pre-stream story arc. The subsequent episodes would adapt the Briarwoods' arc, also from the Vox Machina campaign. By March 18, 2019, eight 22-minute episodes had been funded.[90] Finally, on April 4, 2019, the last published stretch goal of $8.8 million was reached during the airing of episode 57 of campaign two, pushing the total length of the animated series to ten episodes. A "secret" $10M stretch goal of Willingham being filmed going around a haunted house was reached April 16.[91] The final total raised by the Kickstarter when it closed on April 19, 2019, was $11.3M.[92] When the campaign closed, it was one of the most quickly funded in Kickstarter history, and was the most funded Kickstarter for TV and film projects.[93][94] In June 2020, it was announced that the Fall 2020 debut would be missed due to the COVID-19 pandemic,[95] and a new release date has yet to be made available. The cast will reprise their respective Vox Machina roles, with the exception of Orion Acaba.[96] The adult animated series will be written by Jennifer Muro, and animated by Titmouse, Inc.[88][97] The project is now slated for release in late 2020. In November 2019, Amazon Prime Video announced that they had acquired the streaming rights to The Legend of Vox Machina, and had commissioned 14 additional episodes (two additional episodes for season 1 and a second season of 12 episodes).[98] An update posted to the Kickstarter campaign assured backers they would have access to the first season.[99][20] Books[edit] Art books[edit] On August 18, 2017, at a live show in Indianapolis, a Critical Role art book titled The Chronicles of Exandria Vol. I: The Tale of Vox Machina was announced. It includes backstories for Vox Machina and some of the non-player characters (NPCs), and features artwork from the community. It was released in November 2017.[100] The Chronicles of Exandria Vol. II: The Legend of Vox Machina, a sequel to the first art book, was released in November 2018.[101][102] The first Mighty Nein art book, The Chronicles of Exandria: The Mighty Nein, was published on March 31, 2020.[103][104] Campaign setting books[edit] On August 8, 2016, Green Ronin Publishing announced that it had signed a licensing agreement with Geek & Sundry to release a roleplaying game sourcebook series set in the world of Exandria, written by Mercer and based on the Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition rules via the Wizards of the Coast Open Game License.[105][106]:143 The announcement was made by Chris Pramas, president of Green Ronin and Ryan Copple, General Manager of Geek & Sundry, live on the 62nd episode, Uninviting Waters, at Gen Con 2016.[105] On July 14, 2017, Green Ronin revealed the cover of the first book by illustrator Aaron Riley on Twitter.[107] Only one book was published with Green Ronin—Critical Role: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting—and it is set on the continent of Tal'Dorei where most of Vox Machina's adventures take place.[108] The hardback edition was released at Gen Con 2017 on August 17, 2017,[109] while the PDF version was released on July 17, 2017.[110][111] On January 13, 2020, Wizards of the Coast and Critical Role announced the launch of the second book: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount.[112] The campaign sourcebook was released on March 17, 2020.[113][114] Novels[edit] On March 25, 2021, it was announced that the prequel novel Vox Machina: Kith & Kin by Marieke Nijkamp would be released on October 26, 2021. The novel will focus on the twins, Vex’ahlia and Vax’ildan, encounter with the criminal organization known as The Clasp.[115] "This is the first fiction novel released by Penguin Random House's Del Rey imprint, following a 2019 licensing agreement".[116] Other[edit] On October 20, 2020, the coffee table book The World of Critical Role: The History Behind the Epic Fantasy by Liz Marsham was released.[117] In The New York Times Best Seller list for November 8, 2020, the book was #9 in "Advice, How-To & Miscellaneous".[118] James Grebey, for SyFy Wire, wrote: "In addition to recounting Critical Role’s early days (although not a full history — longtime Critters will probably be unsurprised to know that controversial moments like original castmember Orion Acaba’s exit are largely glossed over), The World of Critical Role offers insights into why the cast made their characters make certain decisions during iconic moments from the campaigns, and it explains how the real-life biographies of the cast influenced their character creation."[119] Comics[edit] Geek & Sundry produced a six-panel series of webcomics weekly from November to December 2015 that describes a "Winter's Crest Festival" that occurred pre-series. The webcomics were written by cast members Ray and Jaffe, and feature artwork by Wendy Sullivan Green.[120] Critical Role: Vox Machina Origins[edit] Main article: Critical Role: Vox Machina Origins On July 22, 2017, at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that a comic book that covers the beginning of Vox Machina pre-stream and pre-game would be published.[121][122][123] It was published by Dark Horse Comics, written by Matthew Colville, drawn by Olivia Samson (a long-time member of the Critical Role community), and both colored and lettered by Chris Northrop.[124][125][126][127] A trade paperback Critical Role: Vox Machina Origins Volume 1 was announced on March 11, 2019, and then was released on October 15, 2019.[103] Critical Role: Vox Machina Origins Volume 2 was written by Jody Houser, drawn by Olivia Samson, colored by MSASSYK, lettered by Ariana Maher, and published by Dark Horse Comics. Issue one was released digitally and in print on July 10, 2019.[128][43] The six issues were collected as a trade paperback that released on August 12, 2020.[129] In September 2020, it was announced that the creative team of the second volume would return for the third volume and that the first issue would be released on December 9, 2020.[130] Critical Role: The Mighty Nein Origins[edit] In November 2020, it was announced that a comic book exploring the backstories of the main characters would be published by Dark Horse Comics. Each issue will have a different creative team: issue one will focus on Jester Lavorre and will be written by Sam Maggs, with line art by Hunter Severn Bonyun, and colors by Cathy Le; issue two will focus on Caleb Widogast and will be written by Jody Houser, with illustrations by Selina Espiritu, and color by Diana Sousa. Issue one is scheduled to be released on June 16, 2021.[131] Critical Role: The Tales of Exandria[edit] In December 2020, it was announced that a comic anthology exploring the side stories of NPCs would be published by Dark Horse Comics. The first four issues will be written by Darcy Van Poelgeest in consultation with Mercer, and illustrated by fan artist CoupleofKooks with cover art by Helen Mask. The first issue will concentrate on Leylas Kryn, the Bright Queen of the Kryn Dynasty, and her eternal lover Quana; the issue is scheduled to be released on March 17, 2021.[132][133] Podcasts[edit] On the 100th episode of Critical Role, the launch of the Critical Role podcast was announced: an audio version of the game sessions.[76][134] It is available on iTunes, Google Play Music, and at the Geek & Sundry website.[135] The first campaign's podcast episodes were released in batches of 10–15, between June 8, 2017,[76] and January 8, 2018.[136] Since the start of the second campaign, the podcast episodes have been released on the following Thursday.[137] Charity involvement[edit] On October 16, 2015, the Extra Life fundraiser episode raised over $20,000 for the Children's Miracle Network during the broadcast.[138] This charity episode included a reappearance of the Critical Rejects, as well as three members of the Critical Role cast: Liam O'Brien, Marisha Ray, and Orion Acaba. During the show, viewers are invited to donate money to 826LA, which is later provided in a lump sum to the charity.[139] Donation amounts and messages appear live on the stream, and on earlier episodes, a list of donors was read at the end of each session. During Geek & Sundry's 2015 Extra Life fundraiser, a special interactive episode was broadcast. This episode alone brought in over $20,000 for the Children's Miracle Network, and the event as a whole raised over $76,000. In late November 2015, Geek & Sundry's Twitch channel held a special Doctors Without Borders fundraiser, with nearly half of the $10,000 goal being raised during the four-hour Critical Role broadcast. In December 2015, the cast released an article on Geek & Sundry, "Critter's Guide to Critmas", in response to the flood of gifts they were receiving from fans, asking them to instead donate to a variety of charities, with a different cast member sponsoring each charity.[140] In Spring 2018, the show held a charity drive for 826LA which resulted in community members donating over $50,000, with a matching amount given by one generous community member. The drive resulted in some prizes being unlocked for the community, such as discount codes for D&D Beyond and Wyrmwood Gaming, a second "Fireside Chat" with Mercer, and a second Honey Heist run by Ray.[80] Critical Role Foundation[edit] Main article: Critical Role Productions § Critical Role Foundation Critical Role Productions launched a new 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, Critical Role Foundation, in September 2020 with the mission statement: "To leave the world better than we found it." CBR reported that "Critical Role Foundation will partner with other organizations in the nonprofit sector that share the same values as Critical Role and its community, in addition to raising emergency relief funds to be put toward immediate humanitarian aid as needed. Its inaugural partnership will be with First Nations Development Institute, which seeks to strengthen Native American economies and communities. CRF aims to raise $50,000 for First Nations, which will fund the Native Youth & Culture Fund for two initiatives over the course of one year."[141] See also[edit] HarmonQuest The Adventure Zone Fantasy podcast References[edit] ^ McMillan, Graeme (June 15, 2020).
