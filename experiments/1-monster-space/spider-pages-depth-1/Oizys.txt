Goddess of misery in Greek mythology In Greek mythology, Oizys (/ˈoʊɪzɪs/; Ancient Greek: Ὀϊζύς, romanized: Oïzús) is the goddess of misery, anxiety, grief, and depression. She is the daughter of Nyx, the goddess of night, and the twin of the god Momus, the god of blame.[1] Her Latin name is Miseria, from which the English word 'misery' is derived. She is also the younger sister of the Greek personification of the day, Hemera. She is a minor goddess without a great cult following, but a primordial goddess of misery and depression with a certain amount of mythological weight nonetheless.
