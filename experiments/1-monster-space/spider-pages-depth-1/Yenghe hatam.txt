Text and interpretation[edit] ýenghê hâtãm âat ýesne paitî vanghô mazdå ahurô vaêthâ ashât hacâ ýånghãmcâ tãscâ tåoscâ ýazamaide. The Pahlavi and Parsi Sanskrit translations read: That one (masculine or neuter singular) of the beings indeed is for worship who Mazda Ahura knows as better according to righteousness from the female beings also These ones (masculine) and these ones (feminine) we worship (the Amesha Spentas and Yazatas). Vazquez's liturgically-inclined translation is: They that are, Who are of any gender, Ahura Mazda knows through Asha of their glorious sacrifices: Thus we offer them worship!
