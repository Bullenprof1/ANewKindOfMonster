After attending Columbia University, he began working in theatre, making his debut as a stage manager and performer on Broadway in All the Way Home in 1960. Additional theatre credits included A Thousand Clowns, Never Too Late, Hogan's Goat, and Thieves. Mulligan made a brief, uncredited appearance in the 1963 film Love with the Proper Stranger, which was directed by his elder brother. He starred with Mariette Hartley in the 1966–67 season comedy series The Hero, in which he played TV star Sam Garret. Garrett had starred in a fictional series as Jed Clayton, U.S. Marshal. The Hero lasted for 16 episodes. Another notable TV appearance was on the I Dream of Jeannie episode "Around the World in 80 Blinks", as a navy commander accompanying Major Nelson (Larry Hagman) on a mission. 1970s to end of career[edit] Mulligan's most notable film role was as General George Armstrong Custer in Little Big Man, whom he portrayed as a borderline psychotic. He also appeared in the disaster movie spoof, The Big Bus (1976), where he was reunited with Larry Hagman, with whom he starred in an episode of I Dream of Jeannie (see above) and the 1966 film "The Group", where he played Dick Brown, Harold's (Hagman) New York artist friend. In 1975, he starred in a radio adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's "The Oblong Box" heard on The CBS Radio Mystery Theater. At the 1991 Emmy Awards Mulligan's best-known roles in television were as Burt Campbell in the sitcom Soap (1977–81), for which he won a Best Actor Emmy Award, and as Dr. Harry Weston in the NBC series Empty Nest, a spin-off of The Golden Girls in which his character had appeared in a couple of episodes. Empty Nest ran for seven seasons, and Mulligan won a Best Actor Emmy Award as well as a Golden Globe Award for his performance. He also played Secretary of State William Seward in Lincoln (1988), a TV movie based on Gore Vidal's novel. Mulligan returned to perform on Broadway and in films, in which he usually played supporting roles. A notable exception was the black comedy S.O.B. (1981), in which he played a leading character, Felix Farmer, a Hollywood producer-director based upon the film's actual producer-director, Blake Edwards. The film starred Julie Andrews and William Holden and again, featured Larry Hagman. Mulligan was cast as Reggie Potter in the television series Reggie (1983). Lasting for only six episodes, it was a loose adaptation of the popular BBC series The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin. In the 1984 film Teachers, he played an eccentric high school history teacher (who in one scene teaches the Battle of the Little Bighorn, once more dressed as General Custer). In 1985, he guested The Twilight Zone episode "Night of the Meek", where he took on the role of Henry Corwin, an alcoholic department store Santa Claus who becomes the genuine article, in the remake of the 1959 Christmas episode "The Night of the Meek", the character that Art Carney had played in the original version. The next year, he appeared in another episode of the series, "The Toys of Caliban". Mulligan lent his voice to Disney's 1988 animated film, Oliver & Company, as the oafish Great Dane named Einstein. His final performance was a voice over on Hey Arnold! in 2000 as the voice of Jimmy Kafka, the long mentioned but never seen former friend of Arnold's Grandpa. Marriages[edit] Mulligan married four times. He was first married to Patricia Jones from 1955 to 1960, with whom he had a son, James.[2] That was followed by marriages to Joan Hackett from January 3, 1966, to June 1973 and Lenore Stevens from 1978 to 1990. His last marriage was to adult film actress Rachel Ryan on April 27, 1992, which only lasted to early 1993. Death[edit] On September 26, 2000, Mulligan died of colorectal cancer at his home in Los Angeles, California.[3] He was 67 years old. At his own request, his remains were cremated and there was no funeral service. Mulligan was survived by his son James Mulligan from his first marriage, and two brothers, Robert and James.[4] Recognition[edit] In 1989, Mulligan won both the Emmy Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for portraying Dr. Harry Weston in Empty Nest (1988–95). On September 30, 1993, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in the television industry, located at 6777 Hollywood Blvd.[5][6] Filmography[edit] Film[edit] Year Title Role Notes 1962 40 Pounds of Trouble Bellhop Uncredited 1963 Love with the Proper Stranger Louie Uncredited 1964 One Potato, Two Potato Joe Cullen 1966 The Group Dick Brown 1969 The Undefeated Dan Morse 1970 Little Big Man George Armstrong Custer 1971 A Change in the Wind 1972 Irish Whiskey Rebellion Paul Lachaise- Alcoholic Actor 1972 Harvey Dr. Lyman Sanderson TV movie 1973 From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E.
