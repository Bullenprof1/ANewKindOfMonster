Taken together, the whole body of cultural universals is known as the human condition. Evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations.[1] Some anthropological and sociological theorists that take a cultural relativist perspective may deny the existence of cultural universals: the extent to which these universals are "cultural" in the narrow sense, or in fact biologically inherited behavior is an issue of "nature versus nurture".

Among the cultural universals listed by Donald Brown[2] are: Language and cognition[edit] Main article: Linguistic universal Language employed to manipulate others Language employed to misinform or mislead Language is translatable Abstraction in speech and thought Antonyms, synonyms Logical notions of "and", "not", "opposite", "equivalent", "part/whole", "general/particular" Binary cognitive distinctions Color terms: black, white Classification of: age, behavioral propensities, body parts, colors, fauna, flora, inner states, kin, sex, space, tools, weather conditions Continua (ordering as cognitive pattern) Discrepancies between speech, thought, and action Figurative speech, metaphors Symbolism, symbolic speech Synesthetic metaphors Tabooed utterances Special speech for special occasions Prestige from proficient use of language (e.g. poetry) Planning Units of time Society[edit] Personal names Family or household Kin groups Peer groups not based on family Actions under self-control distinguished from those not under control Affection expressed and felt Age grades Age statuses Age terms Law: rights and obligations, rules of membership Moral sentiments Distinguishing right and wrong, good and bad Promise/oath Prestige inequalities Statuses and roles[3][4] Leaders De facto oligarchy Property Coalitions Collective identities Conflict Cooperative labor Gender roles Males on average travel greater distances over lifetime Marriage Husband older than wife on average Copulation normally conducted in privacy Incest prevention or avoidance, incest between mother and son unthinkable or tabooed Collective decision making Etiquette Inheritance rules Generosity admired, gift giving Mood- or consciousness-altering techniques and/or substances Redress of wrongs, sanctions Sexual jealousy Sexual violence Shame Territoriality Triangular awareness (assessing relationships among the self and two other people) Some forms of proscribed violence Visiting Trade Beliefs[edit] Further information: Myth and ritual Magical thinking Use of magic to increase life and win love Beliefs about death Beliefs about disease Beliefs about fortune and misfortune Divination Attempts to control weather Dream interpretation Beliefs and narratives Proverbs, sayings Poetry/rhetorics Healing practices, medicine Childbirth customs Rites of passage Music, rhythm, dance, and to some degree associations between music and emotion Play Toys, playthings Death rituals, mourning Feasting Body adornment Hairstyles Art Technology[edit] Shelter Control of fire Tools, tool making Weapons, spear Containers Cooking Lever Cordage Non-nativist explanations[edit] The observation of the same or similar behavior in different cultures does not prove that they are the results of a common underlying psychological mechanism. One possibility is that they may have been invented independently due to a common practical problem.[5] Outside influence could be an explanation for some cultural universals.[6] This does not preclude multiple independent inventions of civilization and is therefore not the same thing as hyperdiffusionism; it merely means that cultural universals are not proof of innateness.[7] See also[edit] Animal culture Archetype Biocultural anthropology Culture Social learning Social norm References[edit] ^ Schacter, Daniel L, Daniel Wegner and Daniel Gilbert. 2007.
