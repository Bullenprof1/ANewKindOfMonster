Release[edit] Love premiered on March 8, 2014, at the Cinequest Film Festival in San Jose, California.[5] Reception[edit] Dread Central was enthusiastic about "the sheer amount of charm and fun that is crammed into this movie": "Jackson has crafted an incredibly funny, rich, and ultimately entertaining movie with enough heart to keep you hooked till the end. ... It's a perfect combination of cheesy love story and campy monster movie. ... A lot of my enjoyment from the film comes from how over-the-top it goes, while still maintaining a human element with the love story goofiness. A movie that starts with standard love drama goes to zombies, goose zombies, moose zombies, hordes of squirrel zombies, Abraham Lincoln scientist, Russian immigrant Uncle Sam, and an actual Bigfoot showdown."[6] The Best Horror Movies review was also strongly positive, describing Love as "a highly entertaining film" with "smart and witty" dialogue.[7] Two rave reviews appeared at Aberrant Films, with Spider Santana giving it a 10/10 rating (calling it a "campy little gem") and Sky Tallone a 9/10 ("unlike your traditional campy horror-comedy, this story actually has very compelling characters with well-defined relationships, romances, back stories, personal struggles, and well-written dialogue").[8] The Undead Review gave the movie a 4.5/5 rating, calling it "a strange, hilarious, and yet still chilling film that I would highly recommend."[9] References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g "Production Team".
