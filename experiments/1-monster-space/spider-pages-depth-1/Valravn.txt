Supernatural raven in Danish folklore In Danish folklore, a valravn (Danish "raven of the slain") is a supernatural raven. The ravens appear in traditional Danish folksongs, where they are described as originating from ravens who consume the bodies of the dead on the battlefield, as capable of turning into the form of a knight after consuming the heart of a child, and, alternately, as half-wolf and half-raven creatures.

The ravens became valravne. The valravne that ate the king's heart gained human knowledge and could perform great malicious acts, could lead people astray, had superhuman powers, and were "terrible animals".[1] In another account, a valravn is described as a peaceless soul in search of redemption that flies by night (but never day) and can only free itself from its animal countenance by consuming the blood of a child. This is reflected in a Danish traditional song that describes how, after refusing offers of riches, the Valravn makes an agreement with a maiden to take her to her betrothed after she promises the valravn her first born son. After the agreement, the valravn flies away. In time, the couple have a child and the Valravn returns, and asks the maiden if she has forgotten her promise. The valravn takes the child away, and tears into the chest of his won wager and consumes the blood contained within the child's heart. As a result, the valravn transforms into a knight. This traditional song was reinterpreted by the electro-folk band Sorten Muld and became a hit for them in 1997, under the title Ravnen. Other accounts describe valravns as monsters that are half-wolf and half-raven.[2] Interpretations and theories[edit] According to 19th century scholar Jacob Grimm, the "vilde ravn or vilde valravn" ("wild raven or wild Valravn") take "exactly the place of the diabolical trold" in Danish folk songs. Grimm proposes an Old High German equivalent to the Danish valravn; *walahraban.[3] Modern influence[edit] The Valravn has inspired occasional pop culture references, including an early 20th century book of short stories[4] as well as the Faroese musical group bearing the name, who play a form of traditional music.[5] Valravn was the title of a Danish Germanic Neopagan magazine published from 2002 to 2007.[6] The name is also mentioned in Danish children's books.[7] The 2017 video game Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice features Valravn as "god of illusion", a stage boss the player must defeat to proceed in the game.[8] Valravn appear as an enemy in the 5th bestiary of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, using Grimm's Vilderavn moniker for the creature.[9] Valravn is the name of Cedar Point's 2016 dive roller coaster.[10] Valravns feature in the fantasy novel The Absolute Book (2019) by Elizabeth Knox.
