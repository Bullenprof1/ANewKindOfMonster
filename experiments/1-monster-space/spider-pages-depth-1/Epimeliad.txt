However, the word for "apple" (μηλον) in ancient Greek texts is also the word for "sheep". This translation gives Epimeliads as protectors of sheep and goats. Their hair is white, like apple blossoms or undyed wool. They are also called Maliades or Meliades (Μηλιαδες) which means "of sheep" or "of apples". Like other dryads, they can shape-shift from trees to humans. They are also known to be the guards of the tree that the Golden Fleece was kept on.
