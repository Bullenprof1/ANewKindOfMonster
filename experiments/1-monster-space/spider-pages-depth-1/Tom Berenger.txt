Moore graduated in 1967 from Rich East High School in Park Forest, Illinois.[4] He studied journalism at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri, but decided to seek an acting career following his graduation in 1971 with a Bachelor of Arts degree.

He transferred to New York in 1973.[5] Moore selected "Berenger" as his professional name after he was forced to change his surname professionally, as there was already a "Tom Moore" in the Actors' Equity Association.[4] Berenger worked in soap operas and had a starring role as lawyer Tim Siegel on One Life to Live. His feature film debut was the lead in Rush It (1976), an independent film. In 1977, he had a small role as the killer of the lead character (played by Diane Keaton) in Looking for Mr. Goodbar based on the murder of schoolteacher Roseann Quinn. In 1978, he had a starring role in In Praise of Older Women for Avco-Embassy Pictures. In 1979, he played Butch Cassidy in Butch and Sundance: The Early Days, a role he got in part because of his resemblance to Paul Newman,[6] who played the character in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). Berenger starred in several significant films in the 1980s, including The Big Chill (1983), Eddie and the Cruisers (1983), Platoon (1986), Someone to Watch Over Me (1987), Shoot to Kill (1988), and Major League (1989). In 1986, he received an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Staff Sergeant Barnes in Platoon (this performance won him a Golden Globe Award for "Best Supporting Actor"). A role for which he has become well known for is Thomas Beckett, the main character in the mid-1990s film Sniper (which would later be followed by six sequels, featuring Berenger in the starring role for four). Other notable films from that period in which he was featured include Born on the Fourth of July (1989), Shattered (1991), Sliver (1993), and Chasers (1994). When asked in a 1999 interview to name his favorite film out of those in which he had acted, Berenger said it was too difficult to choose but that the one he had watched most frequently was his 1993 film Gettysburg, where he played the role of General James Longstreet.[7] He established the Tom Berenger Acting Scholarship Fund in 1988 to award theatre students for excellence in performance. In more recent years, Berenger has continued to have an active acting career in film and television, although often at a supporting level. One of his most notable television appearances was on Cheers in its last season as Rebecca Howe's blue collar-plumber love interest, for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award for "Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series". He also began a career as a producer in the 1990s.[citation needed] Berenger co-produced the 1997 miniseries Rough Riders, also starring as Theodore Roosevelt. Berenger was also seen on the box art and promotional content for Novalogic's Delta Force: Black Hawk Down, as his roles in Sniper 2 and Sniper 3 were very similar to what was chosen for the game's artwork. He starred in the mini-series version of Stephen King's Nightmares & Dreamscapes, as a celebrated author who realizes the warped painting he recently purchased is alive with illustrations of impending doom for him in "The Road Virus Heads North". Berenger stars opposite Armand Assante and Busta Rhymes in the dramatic thriller Breaking Point, which had a limited release starting in December 2009. Berenger appeared in the 2010 science fiction thriller Inception with Leonardo DiCaprio and Cillian Murphy, where he played a business executive who served as a mentor to and was an associate of the father of Murphy's character. It was his first major film role since Training Day in 2001. In 2012 he appeared in the TV miniseries Hatfields & McCoys as Jim Vance, uncle of protagonist Devil Anse Hatfield (played by Kevin Costner). On September 23, 2012 Berenger earned a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the role.[8] Personal life[edit] Berenger married four times and has six children. He has two children by his first wife, Barbara Wilson, to whom he was married from 1976 to 1984: Allison Moore (born 1977) and Patrick Moore (born 1979). He has three daughters by second wife Lisa Williams (to whom he was married from 1986 to 1997): Chelsea Moore (born 1986), Chloe Moore (born 1988) and Shiloh Moore (born 1993). He has a daughter named Scout Moore (born 1998) with Patricia Alvaran, to whom he was married from 1998–2011. He married Laura Moretti in Sedona, Arizona, in early September 2012.[9] Filmography[edit] Film[edit] Year Title Role Notes 1977 The Sentinel Man at End 1977 Looking for Mr. Goodbar Gary 1978 Rush It Richard Moore 1978 In Praise of Older Women Andras Vayda 1979 Butch and Sundance: The Early Days Butch Cassidy / Robert Leroy Parker 1980 The Dogs of War Drew Blakeley 1982 Beyond the Door Matthew Jackson 1983 The Big Chill Sam Weber 1983 Eddie and the Cruisers Frank Ridgeway 1984 Fear City Matt Rossi 1985 Rustlers' Rhapsody Rex O'Herlihan 1986 Platoon Staff Sergeant Bob Barnes Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture Nominated—Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor 1987 Someone to Watch Over Me Detective Mike Keegan 1988 Shoot to Kill Jonathan Knox 1988 Betrayed Gary Simmons 1988 Last Rites Michael 1989 Major League Jake Taylor 1989 Born on the Fourth of July Gunnery Sergeant Hayes 1990 Love at Large Harry Dobbs 1990 The Field The American 1991 Shattered Dan Merrick 1991 At Play in the Fields of the Lord Lewis Moon 1993 Sniper Gunnery Sergeant Tom Beckett 1993 Sliver Jack Landsford Nominated—Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor 1993 Gettysburg Lieutenant General James Longstreet 1994 Major League II Jake Taylor 1994 Chasers Rock Reilly 1995 Last of the Dogmen Lewis Gates 1996 The Substitute Jonathan Shale 1996 An Occasional Hell Dr. Ernest Dewalt 1998 The Gingerbread Man Pete Randle 1998 Shadow of Doubt Jack Campioni 1999 A Murder of Crows Detective Clifford Dubose 1999 One Man's Hero John Riley 1999 Diplomatic Siege General Buck Swain 1999 Turbulence 2: Fear of Flying Sikes Direct-to-video 2000 Takedown McCoy Rollins 2001 Training Day District Attorney Stanley 'Stan' Gursky 2001 The Hollywood Sign Tom Greener 2001 True Blue Rembrandt 'Remy' Macy 2001 Watchtower Art Stoner 2002 D-Tox Hank 2002 Sniper 2 Gunnery Sergeant Tom Beckett Television film 2004 Sniper 3 Gunnery Sergeant Tom Beckett Direct-to-video 2007 The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey Jonathan Toomey 2008 Stiletto Virgil Vadalos 2009 Silent Venom Admiral Bradley Wallace 2009 Charlie Valentine Becker 2009 Breaking Point Steven Luisi 2010 Smokin' Aces 2: Assassins' Ball Hal Leuco / FBI Agent Walter Weed Direct-to-video 2010 Sinners and Saints Captain Trahan 2010 Inception Peter Browning Nominated—Phoenix Film Critics Society Award for Best Cast 2010 Faster Warden 2011 Last Will Frank Emery 2011 Bucksville The Patron of Justice 2012 Brake Agent Ben Reynolds 2012 War Flowers General McIntire 2014 Bad Country Lutin 2014 Doc Holliday's Revenge Judge Wells 2014 Lonesome Dove Church John Shepherd 2014 Sniper: Legacy Gunnery Sergeant Tom Beckett Direct-to-video 2014 Reach Me Teddy 2015 Impact Earth Herbert Sloan 2017 Sniper: Ultimate Kill Gunnery Sergeant Tom Beckett Direct-to-video 2017 Cops and Robbers Captain Randolph 2018 American Dresser John Moore 2018 Battle of the Bulge: Wunderland Major McCulley Direct-to-video 2018 Gone Are the Days Will 2018 1st Born Jefferson Tucker 2019 Sargasso Joe Smith 2019 Supervized Ray 2020 Blood and Money Jim Reed 2020 Adam Jerry Niskar 2020 Sniper: Assassin's End Gunnery Sergeant Tom Beckett Direct-to-video 2020 Battle of the Bulge: Winter War Major McCulley Direct-to-video Television[edit] Year Title Role Notes 1975–1976 One Life to Live Tim Siegel 66 episodes 1977 Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye Billy Sutton Television movie 1979 Flesh & Blood Bobby Fallon Television movie 1986 If Tomorrow Comes Jeff Stevens 3 episodes (miniseries) 1993 Cheers Don Santry 2 episodes Nominated—Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series 1995 Body Language Gavin St. Claire Television movie 1995 The Avenging Angel Miles Utley Television movie 1997 Rough Riders Theodore Roosevelt 2 episodes (miniseries) 1999 In the Company of Spies Kevin Jefferson Television movie 2000 Law & Order Dean Tyler Episode: "Panic" 2000 Cutaway Red Line Television movie 2001 Johnson County War Cain Hammett Television movie 2002 Ally McBeal Harrison Wyatt Episode: "Nine One Nine" 2002 The Junction Boys Paul 'Bear' Bryant Television movie 2003 Third Watch Aaron Noble 4 episodes 2003 Peacemakers Marshal Jared Stone 9 episodes 2004 Capital City Senator Foxworthy Television movie 2005 Into the West Colonel J.
