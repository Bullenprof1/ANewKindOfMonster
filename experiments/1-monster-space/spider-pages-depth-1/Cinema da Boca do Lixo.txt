The 1970s saw an influx of production companies to the area and producers such as Antônio Polo Galante, David Cardoso, Nelson Teixeira Mendes, Juan Bajon, Cláudio Cunha, Aníbal Massaini Neto made investments in Boca de Lixo. The result was cinema da Boca, low-budget films with superficial content, produced for quick returns to investors. Although identified foremost with pornochanchadas, Boca was the center of a set of various subgenres of exploitation films including comedies, crime films, action films, and kung fu films. The end of censorship in Brazilian cinema after the fall of the military regime in 1985, pornographic films began to be produced as well. During its most prolific years, Boca attracted many notable directors, among whom were Carlos Reichenbach, Luiz Castelini, Alfredo Sternheim, Juan Bajon, Cláudio Cunha, Walter Hugo Khouri, Fauzi Mansur, and José Mojica Marins.
