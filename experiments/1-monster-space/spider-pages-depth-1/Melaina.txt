Her father was one of the local river gods, either Kephisos or Pleistos of northern Boeotia.[2][3] Melaina was also identified with Thyia who is named as the mother of Delphos in other traditions. In some legends, she is called the daughter of Persephone by Hades. References[edit] ^ Mike Campbell, Behind the Name ^ Pausanias, 10.6.1. ^ Apollonius Rhodius. Argonautica, 2.710.
