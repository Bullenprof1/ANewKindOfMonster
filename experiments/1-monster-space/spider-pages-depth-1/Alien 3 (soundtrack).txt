This sample is taken from the part where the escape pod is hurtling through the planet's atmosphere. Cue of the failed attempt to capture the alien. Cue from the scene where the sprinkler system is activated to destroy the alien. The cue from the scene where Ripley commits suicide in the blast furnace.
