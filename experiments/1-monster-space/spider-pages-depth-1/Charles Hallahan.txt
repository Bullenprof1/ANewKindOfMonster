He also served in the US Navy in the early 1960s, including time as a Navy hospital corpsman stationed in Puerto Rico. In 1982, he portrayed geologist Vance Norris in the remake of The Thing. His most notable role came when he portrayed volcanologist Dr. Paul Dreyfus in the 1997 disaster-thriller film Dante's Peak. Hallahan also co-starred as a regular cast member in two popular television series, Grace Under Fire and the long-running The Paper Chase. He had a brother, Fr. Kenneth Hallahan, a Roman Catholic priest in New Jersey.[3] Death[edit] In 1997, Hallahan was cast as Liam Bilby for the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode "Honor Among Thieves". On November 25, 1997, he died of an apparent heart attack while driving his car in Los Angeles.[4] Nick Tate assumed the role of Liam Bilby in Hallahan's memory.
