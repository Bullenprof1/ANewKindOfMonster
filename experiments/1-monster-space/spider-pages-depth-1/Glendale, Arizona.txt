William John Murphy, a native of New Hartford, New York, who resided in the town of Flagstaff in what was then known as the territory of Arizona, was in charge of building a 40-mile-long (64 km) Arizona Canal from Granite Reef to New River for the Arizona Canal Company. In 1885, he completed the canal, which would bring water to the desert land.[5] Murphy was deep in debt, since he had agreed to be paid in Arizona Canal Company stock and bonds and land instead of cash.[6] William John Murphy – Founder of Glendale In 1887, Murphy formed the Arizona Improvement Company. His objective was to sell the land and water rights south of the canal. Murphy raised capital from out of state sources in order to meet payroll and construction expenses.[6] Murphy decided to refer to this land as "Glendale". In order to develop and interest potential investors and settlers in this new town, Murphy decided to provide a better way of access from Phoenix to Glendale and ending in the town of Peoria by building an 18-mile-long (29 km) diagonal road which he named Grand Avenue. In 1891, Burgess Hadsell worked with Murphy to bring 70 Brethren and River Brethren families to Glendale to form a temperance colony. Soon settlers, attracted by the town's ban on alcoholic beverages, continued to arrive. In 1895, Murphy platted the original town site and amended the plat to include a town park and some business lots. It was bounded by Lamar Road on the south, 55th Avenue on the east, Myrtle Avenue on the north, and 59th Avenue on the west.[7] The construction of a railroad from Prescott to Phoenix was made possible with an exchange of the right-of-way made by Murphy along Grand Avenue.[5] The railroad allowed Glendale settlers to transport goods to the north and easily receive building materials. The construction and commercial applications of the Beet Sugar Factory in 1906, also contributed to the growth of Glendale. Though the operations of the factory only lasted until 1913, it played an important role in the increase of immigrant and migrant settlers in the city.[8] Geography[edit] Glendale is located at 33°32′19″N 112°11′11″W﻿ / ﻿33.53861°N 112.18639°W﻿ / 33.53861; -112.18639 (33.538654, −112.186261).[9] Climate[edit] Climate data for Phoenix Int'l, Arizona (1981–2010 normals,[a] extremes 1895–present)[b] Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °F (°C) 88 (31) 92 (33) 100 (38) 105 (41) 114 (46) 122 (50) 121 (49) 117 (47) 116 (47) 107 (42) 99 (37) 87 (31) 122 (50) Mean maximum °F (°C) 78.7 (25.9) 82.8 (28.2) 90.0 (32.2) 98.6 (37.0) 105.9 (41.1) 112.5 (44.7) 114.4 (45.8) 112.5 (44.7) 108.6 (42.6) 100.1 (37.8) 88.1 (31.2) 77.1 (25.1) 115.2 (46.2) Average high °F (°C) 67.2 (19.6) 70.7 (21.5) 76.9 (24.9) 85.2 (29.6) 94.8 (34.9) 103.9 (39.9) 106.1 (41.2) 104.4 (40.2) 99.8 (37.7) 88.5 (31.4) 75.5 (24.2) 66.0 (18.9) 86.6 (30.3) Average low °F (°C) 45.6 (7.6) 48.7 (9.3) 53.5 (11.9) 60.2 (15.7) 69.4 (20.8) 77.7 (25.4) 83.5 (28.6) 82.7 (28.2) 76.9 (24.9) 64.8 (18.2) 52.7 (11.5) 44.8 (7.1) 63.4 (17.4) Mean minimum °F (°C) 36.2 (2.3) 39.4 (4.1) 43.2 (6.2) 49.5 (9.7) 58.0 (14.4) 68.4 (20.2) 73.7 (23.2) 73.7 (23.2) 67.1 (19.5) 53.6 (12.0) 40.8 (4.9) 34.6 (1.4) 33.5 (0.8) Record low °F (°C) 16 (−9) 24 (−4) 25 (−4) 35 (2) 39 (4) 49 (9) 63 (17) 58 (14) 47 (8) 34 (1) 27 (−3) 22 (−6) 16 (−9) Average precipitation inches (mm) 0.91 (23) 0.92 (23) 0.99 (25) 0.28 (7.1) 0.11 (2.8) 0.02 (0.51) 1.05 (27) 1.00 (25) 0.64 (16) 0.58 (15) 0.65 (17) 0.88 (22) 8.03 (204) Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) 4.1 4.4 3.9 1.7 1.0 0.5 4.2 5.0 2.8 2.5 2.6 3.9 36.6 Average relative humidity (%) 50.9 44.4 39.3 27.8 21.9 19.4 31.6 36.2 35.6 36.9 43.8 51.8 36.6 Average dew point °F (°C) 32.4 (0.2) 32.2 (0.1) 32.9 (0.5) 31.6 (−0.2) 34.3 (1.3) 39.0 (3.9) 56.1 (13.4) 58.3 (14.6) 52.3 (11.3) 43.0 (6.1) 35.8 (2.1) 33.1 (0.6) 40.1 (4.5) Mean monthly sunshine hours 256.0 257.2 318.4 353.6 401.0 407.8 378.5 360.8 328.6 308.9 256.0 244.8 3,871.6 Percent possible sunshine 81 84 86 90 93 95 86 87 89 88 82 79 87 Source: NOAA (relative humidity and sun 1961–1990)[10][11][12], Weather.com[13] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 55.8 square miles (145 km2), of which 55.7 square miles (144 km2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) (0.13%) is water.
