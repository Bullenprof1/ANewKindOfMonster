This article is about the filk band. For the reggae band, see Ooklah The Moc. Ookla the Mok at DucKon 2008 Ookla the Mok is a filk band fronted by Rand Bellavia and Adam English. The two met as undergraduates while attending Houghton College in 1988. The band is named after a character from the Ruby-Spears Productions cartoon Thundarr the Barbarian, created by Steve Gerber. They provided the theme song to Disney's Fillmore!,[1] and scored the feature film Bite Me, Fanboy! They have won four Pegasus Awards[2][3][4] for excellence in filk music, and the 2014 Logan Award[5] for Outstanding Original Comedy Song ("Mwahaha"). Ookla the Mok had the most requested song on Dr. Demento's syndicated radio show in both 2012 ("Tantric Yoda") [6] and 2013 ("Mwahaha").[7] Two of their songs ("Stop Talking About Comic Books or I'll Kill You" and "F. People") have appeared on Dr. Demento CD compilations.[8] Contents 1 Band members 1.1 Current 1.2 Former 2 Musical style 3 Other appearances 4 Performances 5 Discography 6 References 7 External links Band members[edit] Current[edit] Rand Bellavia – vocals, guitar, percussion, trombone, keyboards, kazoo (1992–present) Adam English – vocals, guitar, keyboards, accordion, trumpet (1992–present) Rand and Adam continue to perform live with Luis Garcia and Mike Mallory whenever geography and convention budgets allow for it—most recently at Windycon in Chicago in November 2016.

For example, their song "Arthur Curry" from Less Than Art pokes fun at Aquaman and the way his super-powers don't seem to compare favorably with the rest of the Super Friends. Another example is "Stop Talking About Comic Books Or I'll Kill You" from Super Secret. "Song of Kong" from Smell No Evil takes a tongue-in-cheek look at the relationship between King Kong and Godzilla. "W.W.S.D.?" from oh okay LA asks its listeners to ask themselves "What would Scooby do?". "Mr. W" from the same album paints a nightmare scenario of Mr. Worf being in command of Star Trek's starship Enterprise. "Spot The Cat" from Dave Lennon sets to music a poem originally read by Star Trek's Data (written by Clay Dale). Tribute songs about celebrities Gary Coleman, Michael Jackson, Cher, and Sting also appear on oh okay LA. Other appearances[edit] Rand's voice and Adam's keyboards can be heard on the international top five hit "Cupid's Chokehold" by Gym Class Heroes. Performances[edit] Ookla the Mok were the musical guests of honor at the 2007 MarsCon in Bloomington, Minnesota, the international guests of honour at the 2009 British Filk Convention, and the music guests of honor at the 2014 FenCon.
