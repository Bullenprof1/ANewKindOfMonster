Indian ghost movies are popular not just in India but in the Middle East, Africa, South East Asia and other parts of the world. Generally the movies are based on the experiences of modern people who are unexpectedly exposed to ghosts. Some Indian ghost movies, such as the comedy/horror film Chandramukhi, have been great hits, dubbed into several languages.[1] They usually draw on traditional Indian literature or folklore, but in some cases are remakes of Western movies, such as Anjaane, based on Alejandro Amen√°bar's ghost story The Others.[2] ^ Shoaib Mohamed (September 24, 2007).
