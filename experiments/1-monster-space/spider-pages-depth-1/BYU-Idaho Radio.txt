History[edit] KBYI logo used until March 2011. KRIC signed on at then-Ricks College in September 1972. It was a 10-watt station on 90.1 MHz.[2] In May 1984, KRIC moved to 100.5 MHz and increased its power to 75,000 watts.[3] In 2011, KBYI moved to 94.3 MHz. The move was part of a multi-state, multi-station series of changes in frequency assignments, which included three swaps in Rexburg and Idaho Falls. The 94.3 frequency was vacated by KSNA, which moved to 99.1; the 99.1 license of KUPI-FM moved to 100.7; and KBYI moved to 94.3.
