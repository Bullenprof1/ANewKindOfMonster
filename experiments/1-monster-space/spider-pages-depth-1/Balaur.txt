For the dinosaur, see Balaur bondoc. A dragon sculpture in Romania. A balaur (pl. balauri) in Romanian folklore is a type of many-headed dragon or monstrous serpent, sometimes said to be equipped with wings. The number of heads is usually around three, but they can also have seven heads or even twelve heads according to some legends. The balaur in folktale is typically evil, demanding or abducting young maidens or the princess, and defeated by the hero such as Saint George or the fair youth Făt-Frumos. There is some lore in which the balaur is considered weather-making, and living in an airborne state, but these types of balaur are sometimes interchangeably called hala or ala, being confounded with the pan-Slavic air and water demon. The balaur (instead of the zmeu) is the vehicle of the weather-controlling Solomonari according to some sources. There are also legends about the balaur in which they can produce precious stones from their saliva.

This is the type Pamfile calls the "third type" that is air-dwelling.[5] When two balauri meet and fight in the air, there ensues various meteorological damages such as uprooting of trees, or objects being tossed about.[5] Another tradition is that the balaur uses the rainbow as its path and sucks moisture from any spot in order to cause rain.[5] There is also lore about the balaur which is said to be quite similar to the Bulgarian Banat lore about the lamia (locally called lam'a), which states that the lam'a draw water from the sea to fill the cloud.[8][b] Although the dragons ridden by the Solomonari are often said to be zmei (sing. zmeu),[9] they were balauri according to some sources. A balaur was controlled by these weather-controlling sorcerers using "a golden rein" (or golden bridle; Romanian: un frâu de aur).[c] The dragons were usually kept hidden in the depths of a lake, until summoned by their riders.[10][11][12] Etymology[edit] The term Balaur (Macedo-Romanian bul'ar) is of unknown etymology. It has been linked with Albanian boljë/bollë ("snake") and buljar ("water snake"),[1] terms possibly stemming from the same Thracian root, *bell- or *ber- "beast, monster", the traces of which can also be found in the name of the Greek mythological hero Bellerophon ("the beast killer").[13][14] The Transylvanian Saxon balaur "dragon", and balaura, an insult term in Serbia, are borrowed from Romanian.[14][15] The Serbo-Croatian blavor/blaor/blavur ("European legless lizard") is cognate with balaur,[16] and is regarded as one of the few pre-Slavic Balkan relict words in Serbo-Croatian.[15] The maniraptor theropod Balaur bondoc is named after this creature. Popular culture[edit] In the MMORPG Aion, the Dragons that once ruled the world and are the enemy are called the Balaur. In the MMORPG Star Trek Online the largest class of Gorn warship is the Balaur Dreadnought.[17] Retrieved 2011-06-19. In Ace Combat: Joint Assault, there is a gigantic railgun weapon named the Balaur.
