The film is based on the Dorothy Macardle novel Uneasy Freehold (1941), published in the United States as The Uninvited (1942), and deals with a brother and sister who purchase a home in Cornwall plagued by paranormal events. The film was part of a cycle of supernatural-themed films that began appearing in the mid-1940s. Dodie Smith began the writing of the film, with Frank Partos brought in by his friend, associate producer Charles Brackett. Brackett was in meetings to have the film directed by Alfred Hitchcock but could not organize plans with him, leading to the film's being directed by Allen. Filming began on April 16, 1943. Allen found the most difficult part of shooting to be working with Gail Russell, who was inexperienced and began crying several times during filming. The Uninvited was released in Washington, D.C., on February 10, 1944, and was among the higher-grossing films of the year. On its release it received strong reviews from various trade papers (Variety, Harrison's Reports and The Monthly Film Bulletin), as well as from critics such as Bosley Crowther and James Agee. Critics were surprised that the film's supernatural elements were presented as real and that they found it genuinely frightening. The film continued to get praise in retrospective reviews from Carlos Clarens and Phil Edwards, while other critics, such as Pauline Kael and James Marriott, gave the film more mixed reviews. In the 1940s, director of photography Charles Lang Jr. was nominated for an Academy Award for his work on the film, and film was later adapted into two radio plays with Milland. The film did not create a wave of supernatural-themed horror films but led to further work by director Allen with Russell and with Milland. The song "Stella by Starlight" that was created for the film later became a popular jazz standard, being performed by Frank Sinatra, Charlie Parker and Miles Davis.

They purchase it for an unusually low price from Commander Beech. Rick and Pamela meet Beech's 20-year-old granddaughter, Stella Meredith, who lives with her grandfather in the nearby town of Biddlecombe. Stella is deeply upset by the sale because of her attachment to the house, despite its being where her mother, Mary Meredith, fell to her death from a nearby cliff. The commander has forbidden Stella to enter the house or to see Rick. However, she gains access to Windward House through Rick, who becomes infatuated with her. The Fitzgeralds' initial enchantment with the house diminishes when they unlock an artist's studio where they feel an inexplicable chill. Just before dawn, Rick hears the sobs of an unseen woman, a phenomenon that Pamela investigates whilst awaiting her brother's return with their Irish housekeeper, Lizzie Flynn. The superstitious Lizzie notices a peculiar draft on the stairs. Rick and Pamela must face the obvious: Windward House is haunted. When Stella comes to Windward for dinner, she senses a spirit. Rather than fearing it, she associates the calming presence with her mother. Suddenly she dashes out towards the very cliff from which her mother Mary fell to her death seventeen years earlier. Rick catches her just before she reaches the edge. Stella professes to have no recollection of the near-fatal incident. The Fitzgeralds and the town physician, Dr. Scott, investigate. They learn that Stella's father, a painter, had had an affair with his model, a Spanish gypsy named Carmel. Mary, from all accounts a beautiful and virtuous woman, found out and took Carmel to Paris, leaving her there. Subsequently, Carmel returned to England, stole the infant Stella from Windward, and, during a confrontation, pushed Mary off the cliff to her death. Shortly afterward, Carmel became ill and died. Rick tries to dissuade Stella from her dangerous attraction to Windward by staging a séance to convey the "message" that her mother wants her to stay away. However, the ghost takes over and communicates that it is guarding Stella. Stella becomes possessed by the spirit and begins muttering in Spanish. Distressed by Stella's renewed involvement with Windward, Beech sends Stella to a sanitorium run by Miss Holloway, Mary's friend and confidante. The Fitzgeralds visit and question Holloway, unaware that Stella is confined there. Holloway explains that after Mary's death, she took care of Carmel, who had contracted pneumonia and eventually died of it. Looking through the records of the previous village physician, Dr. Scott discovers that Holloway may have hastened Carmel's death. The doctor is called away to care for an ailing Beech, who tells him that Stella is at the sanitorium. Rick, Pam, and Scott telephone Miss Holloway to inform her that they are on their way. Holloway deceives Stella, saying that the Fitzgeralds have invited her to live with them. Stella happily takes the train home. Holloway tells the would-be rescuers that Stella is on her way to Windward House. There Stella finds only her grandfather in the studio. He begs Stella with his last strength to get out, but she remains at his side. When a ghost manifests, the commander succumbs to a heart attack. Stella welcomes the ghost, believing it to be her mother, but the apparition frightens her, and she flees towards the cliff. Rick and Dr. Scott get there just in time to pull Stella from the crumbling cliff to safety. Back inside, the group is drawn again to the physician's journal, which the friendly spirit has opened to a certain page. They discover that Carmel gave birth to a child in Paris, where Stella herself was born. The truth becomes clear: Carmel is Stella's mother. Stella's realization of her true parentage frees Carmel's spirit to leave Windward. Something evil, though, has remained. After sending everyone away, Rick confronts the spirit of Mary Meredith, telling her that they are no longer afraid of her and that she has no power over them any longer. Defeated, Mary's spirit departs.

Simpson as Will Hardy, tobacconist Production[edit] During World War II and its aftermath, there was small cycle of supernatural themed films.[2] These included A Guy Named Joe (1943), A Matter of Life and Death (1946) and The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947).[2] Jack Cartwright wrote in Motion Picture Daily wrote in 1944 that there was a trend "higher bracket horror pictures" around this period.[3] This led developed films such as Dead of Night (1945) and The Uninvited.[4] Associate producer Charles Brackett would write about working with Dodie Smith on The Uninvited as early as September 29, 1942 noting in his journal entry that the two had "the opening of the pictured doped out with her. The end is still in the mist..."[1][5][6] He would continue meeting with her to discuss the script on throughout the months until on October 15 when Brackett suggested to have her work with Frank Partos.[7] Partos was a Hungarian-born screenwriter who came to Hollywood as a story scout in 1928.[8] Brackett and Partos had worked together at Paramount in May 1934 for Her Master's Voice and remained friends.[8] According to Brackett, Smith responded negatively to this suggesting, and responded to him saying "You're worse than Sidney Franklin - he only changed one scene."[7] Brackett wrote on October 16 that she received a phone call from Smith stating she thought he was right about the screenplay and apologized to him.[7][9] On October 20th, Brackett met with Erik Charell who gave suggestions for The Uninvited which included "the sound of heart-beats, a fire that goes out, petals that fall form roses and ectoplasm climbing the stairs."[9] Brackett met with Alfred Hitchcock on November 14 and gave him a copy of The Uninvited and asked him to read it.[10] By November 21, Hitchcock was unable to work on The Uninvited but gave Brackett suggestions for the film.[11] By January 1, Smith was still communicating with Brackett about The Uninvited, with Brackett noting that he was "rather disappointed in her revisions, which are always small and niggling" and contemplated taking her off the project.[12] By January 18, Allen had been reading the script for De Sylva and felt that noted that slow pace of the film.[13] By the 21st, they had worked on a more fast-paced and lighter intro for The Uninvited.[14] Allen worked in both West End and Broadway theatre for Gilbert Miller.[15] Allen was connected with agent Louis Shurr who connected him with Buddy DeSylva, an executive at Paramount Pictures.[16] DeSylva had seen a play adaptation of Pride and Prejudice that Allen had directed and offered him work at Paramount.[16] According to Allen, he had about six months of apprenticeship initially in Paramount working with directors like Preston Sturges and Mark Sandrich.[17] During this period, Allen became friends with Brackett.[17] By the 29th, De Sylva contacts Brackett stating he wants The Uninvited produced in March.[12] Brackett officially proposed to Allen to direct The Uninvited on February 6.[18] It would be the first film Lewis Allen would direct.[15] Script work continued on a treatment for The Uninvited by Brackett on February 20 completed the script.[19] On March 2, Brackett read the script to Smith which she approved of.[20] Brackett commented that Smith was "afraid of the job of writing out scenes skeletonized by Frank [Partos], but is going over our first sequences seeing if she can approve them and if so going to work"[20] According to Allen, he had a lot of influence in the casting of the film.[17][21] On the casting of Gail Russell In his March 24th journal entry, Brackett commented that Allen, Partos, and himself were "knocked over the head by her extraordinary beauty." and after seeing her perform in a Hendry Aldrich film commented that "she wasn't bad-not a brilliant actress but something which can really dazzle the beholders, if Lew can squeeze any kind of a performance out of her."[22] Allen admitted he was not particularly happy with the casting of Russell, noting that "when she read for me, it was pretty bad."[21] Also among the cast was Cornelia Otis Skinner who was working Paramount at the time on a screenplay for Our Hearts Were Young and Gay.[21] The film began shooting on April 16.[1] Filming took place in Northern California near Fort Bragg.[23] Scenes of village exteriors and sailings ships were filmed on the backlot of studios.[24] On April 19, Bracket had a budget meeting where he tried to get the schedule for the film stretched from 42 days to 50 with no success.[25] On April 23 on viewing the daily rushes, Brackett commented that Russell's performance was "amateur and adenoidal" while Dodie Smith echoed similar distate for the actress.[26] Filming with Russell proved difficult, with Brackett writing on May 3 that she would cry on set with her mother claiming she had a sore throat while it ended up being that Russel was crying that Allen had made her wear a hat for a scene for which she did not want to wear it.[26] Allen spoke about Russell's performance in the film as "manufactured. She could only do about five or six lines. and then she'd burst into tears."[27] According to Allen, Russell, who had not had alcohol before, began drinking to calm herself under the suggestion of the head of make-up on set.[27] Issues also rose with Ray Milland who on May 8 took eleven takes to film a scene.[26] Allen spoke positively about working with Milland, stating that he was very supportive of him, especially as he was a first time film director.[24] Allen also stated Milland would take Russell aside and continuously practise her lines with her.[28] Allen felt the only person who reacted poorly to Russell was Donald Crisp who did not like working with people he deemed as non-professional actors.[28] Filming had completed by mid-June 1943.[1] In his journals, Brackett stated that June 15 was the final shooting day for The Uninvited.[29] Release[edit] The Uninvited was distributed by Paramount Pictures and was shown in Washington, D.C. on February 10, 1944 and later in New York on Feb 26, 1944.[1] According to the National Box Office Digest, were among the highest in the United States with film had rentals over $500,000.[30] The film was not as high grossing as Paramount's Going My Way or Double Indemnity but grossed more than Allen's other film that year Our Hearts Were Young and Gay and Universal's horror films House of Frankenstein and The Invisible Man's Revenge.[30] William Hays received a letter from Father Brendan Larson, one of the executives of the National Legion of Decency regarding audiences seeing The Uninvited.[31][32] The letters noted that "In certain theaters large audiences of questionable type attend this film as unusual hours. The impression created by their presence as that they had been previously informed of certain erotic and esoteric elements in this film."[32] The letter went on to note how Miss Holloway gazes at Mary's portrait and how they had planned to spend their lives together which led to the author of the letter to state "There is a distinct contrast in the masculinity of Miss Holloway's character andt he dainty femininity of Mary's portrait."[32][33] Paramount denied any intent to convey any lesbian message in the film.[33] On November 18, 1946, Milland performed in a radio broadcast of The Uninvited, hosted by Allen for the The Lady Esther Screen Guild Theater.[1][34] Milland would perform a second radio adaptation in 1949 for Screen Directors Playhouse.[34] The Uninvited was first released on home video on August 27, 1992 by MCA/Universal Home Video [35][36] The Criterion Collection released the film on DVD and Blu-ray on October 22, 2013.[37][38] Criterion's release was a new digital transfer created in a 2K resolution from a 35 mm safety duplicate negative made from a nitrate composite fine-grain.[39] Both radio adaptations of the The Uninvited are included on the disc.[34] Reception[edit] Contemporary reviews[edit] From contemporary reviews, some critics praised the film for how frightening they found it and compared it to other horror films. Karl Krug wrote in the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegram praised the film declaring it "cold shiver melodrama at its best, and it uses no melodramatic claptrap or sliding panel hocus-pocus to achieve its cold chill ends."[40] Krug noting that the film was told with a "deadly seriousness and very little comedy relief its characters intelligent adult human beings, but there is no early explanation offered for the ghosts that haunted house" and commented that audiences should not "look for the conventional "horror" yarn, all tricked up with the sleigh of hand gadgets that usually accompany such stuff int he movies. This one will really give you the shudders, and there are a few places where the suspense will freeze the marrow in your bones, to say nothing of the blood in your veins."[40] These statements were echoed by other reviewers, including Boyd Martin of The Courier-Journal who commented that he generally loathed "these so-called shocker films" and wrote that The Uninvited was "a most intelligent thriller".[41] Outside the United States, Herbert Whittaker of The Gazette Montreal proclaimed that "The movie-goer who gazes stoney-eyed at the usual type of screen thriller should be able to achieve genuine goose-pimples as this one unravels" noting the film did not set itself in "cardboard grave yard, knee-deep in that animated whipped cream that Hollywood technicals like to imagine resembles fog" and the film "will have you clutching the arms of your theatre-seat."[42] James Agee wrote in The Nation made "a mediocre story and a lot of slabby cliches into an unusually good scare-picture. It seems to me harder to get a fright than a laugh, and I experienced thirty-five first-class jolts"[43] Clyde Rowen of The Nebraska State Journal and Star proclaimed that the film 'easily rates as the best mystery movie of recent months [...] not too scary, but exciting enough to hold an audience."[44] Critics were surprised to find the films ghosts in the film turned out to be real, with Rowen commenting "Phantoms in the ordinary motion picture of this sort would automatically turn out to be somebody's cat or an envious neighbor attempting to devaluate a vacant house."[44] A review in the Monthly Film Bulletin "It remains a question, however, whether such a film should ever be made, producing visual evidence of unexplained occult phenomena which, to say the least, have never yet been photographed."[45] The film received received praise from other trade papers as well including Variety and Harrison's Reports.[43] Critics also praised the cast with many specifically pointing out Gail Russell. Whittaker proclaimed that "the picture belongs to a 20-year-old Gail Russell" who "creates a most favorable impression. There's a sort of dewy charm to Miss Russell that is as unusual on the screen as it is appealing."[42] Krug also praised Russel as "a revelation among the newcomers. This youngster can do something beside pose as she radiates the terror that besets her."[40] Rowen specifically noted Russell stating that she was "beautiful and talented, will no doubt be heard from in future Paramount pictures."[44] Martin noting "fine direction by Lewis Allen" and praising the cast, specifically Crisp, Milland, Hussey, Skiner, Napier and Russell who made the film "a drama rich in suspense."[41] A review in the Monthly Film Bulletin found the film very good technically with "some beautiful coastal scenery" and attempts at reconstructing a Devon village, as well as "beautiful interiors" of the house.[45] Bosley Crowther of The New York Times also commented on the cast finding that Milland and Hussey "do nicely as the couple who get themselves involved, being sufficiently humorous in spots to seem plausibly real." and that Russell was "wistful and gracious as a curiously moonstruck girl"[46] Crowther commented on some plot elements noting that the intellectual aspects of the story had better be left unquestioned" noting "glaring confusion in the wherefore and why of what goes on" and that the back stories of the ghosts were not explained.[46] Retrospective[edit] In his 1967 book The Illustrated History of Horror and Science-Fiction Films, Carlos Clarens declared that "Among the seventeen horror films released in the United States during 1944, the best and most unusual is The Uninvited."[47] Clarens described the film as an "adult, polite ghost tale, lacing the disquieting undertow of The Turn of the Screw, the movie had a pleasantly chilling feminine touch [...] most evident in the deft dosage of its well calculated shivers: a flower that wilts in seconds, a dog that refuses to climb the stairs, a scent of mimosa that impregnates a room, a moonlit romantic piano piece that develops into a somber concerto."[47] Phil Edwards wrote in a 1982 article in Starburst proclaimed the film as "one of the few genuinely creepy and one hundred per cent supernatural films that Hollywood has turned out, successfully in all departments " and that the film was "at its best when merely suggesting the horrible, a point which the over-rated and non-ghostly Poltergeist made only too clear."[48][49] Edwards commented on critiques of the films lightness finding it "quite entertaining" and that "sets the film within its generic context, is quite within keeping for films of this nature at the time."[49][50] In Phil Hardy's The Encyclopedia of Horror Movies (1986) referred to the film as "A superior ghost story" but expressed that it was "too mechanically constructed to be genuinely chilling, the film's ghostly manifestations - a flower that wilts in seconds, a dog that refuses to go upstairs and a pair of doors opening for no reason - nonetheless have a real frisson about them."[43] Pauline Kael declared in her book 5001 Nights at the Movies that despites the pictures popularity "it doesn't come anywhere near fulfilling one's initial hopes that it will be a first-rate ghost movie."[51] James Marriott commented in the book The Definitive Guide to Horror Movies that the film felt more dated than even Universal Studios' gothic horror films and despite finding finding the visuals in the film "achieve an effective eeriness", Marriott found Milland's character a "boorishly rational man" and critiqued the plots elements that the villains were women without men or women who refused to bare children.[52][53] Legacy[edit] Director of photography Charles Lang was nominated for an academy award for Best Cinematography, Black-and-White at the 17th Academy Awards for his work in The Uninvited.[54] A the 17th Academy Awards, cinematographer Charles Lang was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography, Black-and-White for his work on The Uninvited.[54] The award went to Joseph LaShelle for his work on Laura.[54] Allen spoke about watching The Uninvited in 1997 stating "I saw The Uninvited about two years ago, and what amazed me about the picture was the fact that it was almost 50 years old and it wasn't very dated. I must be congratulated because most movies of that era look stagy. I must have done a very good job!"[55] Allen followed up that "I treated The Uninvited as though I believed in it. That's my whole explanation for that."[55] The Uninvited did not push Hollywood Studios to create a wave of scary ghost films.[43] Allen would work again with Russell on both his next film Our Hearts Were Young and Gay and The Unseen (1945).[27][43] The song in the film "Stella by Starlight" was later adapted into a popular song with lyrics by Victor Young.[56] The song was recorded again by other artists in the 1940s including Harry James and Frank Sinatra.[57] In the 1952 Charlie Parker covered it while Stan Getz recorded a version of the song which was followed by more than a dozen covers versions in the new two years.[57] The song would be preformed by several jazz musicians, specifically by those with an affinity for cool jazz performed it.[57] These included Chet Baker, Bill Evans and Miles Davis.[57] See also[edit] List of American films of 1944 List of horror films of the 1940s List of Paramount Pictures films (1940–1949) Ray Milland filmography Ruth Hussey filmography References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n "The Uninvited (1944 film)".
