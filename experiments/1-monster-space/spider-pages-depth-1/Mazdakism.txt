The religion has been called one of the most noteworthy examples of pre-modern communism.[1] The religion was founded in the early Sasanian Empire by Zardusht, a Zoroastrian mobad who was a contemporary of Mani (d. 274).[2] However, it is named after its most prominent advocate, Mazdak, who was a powerful and controversial figure during the reign of Emperor Kavad I (r. 498–531).[3] References[edit] ^ Crone 2012, p. 439. sfn error: no target: CITEREFCrone2012 (help) ^ Crone 2012, p. 22. sfn error: no target: CITEREFCrone2012 (help) ^ Daryaee 2014, pp. 26-29. sfn error: no target: CITEREFDaryaee2014 (help) Sources[edit] L.
