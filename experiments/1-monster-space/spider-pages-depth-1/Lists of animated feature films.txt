Theatrical releases as well as made-for-TV (TV) and direct-to-video (V) movies of all types of animation are included. Currently the list doesn't recognize one release form from another. In order to qualify for this list, films must be "over 40 minutes long and have animation in at least 75% of their running time, or have at least 40 minutes of animation in total." This list chooses to use the AFI, AMPAS and BFI definitions of a feature film. For animated films under 40 minutes, see List of animated short films. For marionette films like Team America: World Police, or films featuring non-animated puppets, see Films featuring puppetry. Also, primarily live-action films with heavy use of special effects are also included.
