The first series, a trivia show titled Adventure! Godzilland (冒険！ゴジランド, Bōken! Gojirando), aired on TV Tokyo in 1992. The series was intended to promote the film Godzilla vs. Mothra, and featured both live-action and chibi-style[2] animated segments. Toho then produced a second series, Adventure! Godzilland 2 (冒険！ゴジランド２, Bōken! Gojirando Tsū), which aired in 1993 as a promotion for Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II. These were followed by Get Going! Godzilland (すすめ！ゴジランド, Susume! Gojirando), a series of four OVAs released on VHS in 1994 and 1996 by Gakken Video. Get Going! Godzilland is aimed at teaching children how to read the hiragana alphabet, how to count, and how to perform addition and subtraction.[3] References[edit] ^ Japan Broadcasting Corporation (1994). 日本民間放送年鑑 (in Japanese). コ-ケン出版. p. 649. ^ Francisco, Eric (13 March 2017).
