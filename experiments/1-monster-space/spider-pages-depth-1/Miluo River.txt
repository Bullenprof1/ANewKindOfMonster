Miluo River in Miluo City, Hunan The Miluo River (traditional Chinese: 汨羅江; simplified Chinese: 汨罗江; pinyin: Mìluójiāng, and with modified Wade–Giles using the form Mi-lo) is located on the eastern bank of Dongting Lake, the largest tributary of the Xiang River in the northern Hunan Province. It is an important river in the Dongting Lake watershed,[1] known as the location of the ritual suicide in 278 BC of Qu Yuan, a poet of Chu state during the Warring States period, in protest against the corruption of the era.[2] Originating in Xiushui County of Jiangxi province, the Miluo river is about 400 kilometres (250 mi) long. It passes Pingjiang county in Hunan and empties into Dongting Lake in Miluo city. The river is formed by the confluence of the Mi and Luo rivers, of which the Mi river is the main branch. The two rivers become the Miluo river after joining in Daqiuwan (大丘灣), Miluo city.[3] See also[edit] Qu Yuan（340-278BC) References[edit] ^ (Chinese) 汨罗江 - About Miluo River: bytravel.cn ^ (Chinese) 汨罗江 - About Miluo River: rednet.cn ^ (Chinese) Story of Miluo River (再访汨罗江 共护母亲河): sina.com.cn Coordinates: 29°00′04″N 112°57′00″E﻿ / ﻿29.00111°N 112.95000°E﻿ / 29.00111; 112.95000 v t e Dongting Lake River System Xiang River system Laodao River (捞刀河) Liuyang River (浏阳河) Jin River (靳江) Xiao River (潇水) Wei River (沩水) Tuoshui Juan River(涓水) Miluo River (汨罗江) Xinqiang River (新墙河) Lianshui River (涟水) Lushui River (渌水) Juan River (涓水) Mi River (洣水) Zheng River (蒸水) Lei River (耒水) Chongling River (舂陵江) Qi River (祁水) Bai River Zi River system Fuyi River Yuanjiang River system Wushui (潕水) Chen River Wushui (巫水) Qu River You River Huayuan River Mengdong River Lishui River system Lou River Die River v t e Major rivers of China Yangtze system Yalong Min Dadu Qingyi (Sichuan) Tuo Jialing Bailong Fu (Sichuan) Qu Wu Hanshui Muma Chi Du Bao Qing Chishui Xiang Xiao Lei Mi Zi Yuan Lishui Miluo Gan Fu (Jiangxi) Xin Qingyi (Anhui) Qinhuai Xitiao Huangpu Suzhou Creek Yellow system Daxia Tao Huangshui Datong Qingshui Wuding Fen Wei Jing Luo (Shaanxi) Luo (Henan) Qin Dawen Xiaoqing Pearl system North East West Yujiang Yong Xun Qian Hongshui Nanpan Beipan Rong Li (Guangxi) Gui Liu Heilongjiang system Songhua 2nd Songhua Nen Mudan Ussuri Argun Kherlen Woken Huifa Huai system Guo Ying Shiguan Quan Hui Hong Hai system Chaobai Yongding Hutuo Ziya Daqing Wenyu Juma Sanggan Fuyang Wei Ju Jiyunhe Liao system Hun Taizi Xar Moron Xinkai Western Liao Eastern Liao Other major rivers Tarim Black Karatash Ili Shule Tumen Yalu Luan Red Minjiang Longjiang Lancang Beilun Nujiang Lion Spring Elephant Spring Yarlung Tsangpo Nyang Subansiri Irtysh Suifen Qiantang Puyang Jiao (Shandong) Dai Si Shu Cao'e Jiao (Zhejiang) Ou Mulan Jin (Fujian) Han (Guangdong) Mei Ting Nandu Wanquan Taping Major canals Grand Canal Lingqu North Jiangsu Main Irrigation Canal This article related to a river in China is a stub.
