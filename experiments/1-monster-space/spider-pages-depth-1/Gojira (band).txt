Gojira are a French heavy metal band from Ondres (outskirts of Bayonne). Originally formed as Godzilla in 1996, they changed their name to Gojira in 2001. The band's lineup—consisting of brothers Joe Duplantier (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and Mario Duplantier (drums), Christian Andreu (lead guitar), and Jean-Michel Labadie (bass)—has been the same since the band's name change. Gojira have been known for their spiritual and environment-themed lyrics. They have gone "from the utmost obscurity during the first half of their career to widespread global recognition in the second".[1] Gojira released its debut album Terra Incognita (2001), followed by The Link (2003) and established their reputation through powerful precision in live performances, becoming one of the leading bands of the French metal scene. The band released the critically acclaimed album From Mars to Sirius (2005) which featured "Backbone", "The Heaviest Matter of the Universe" and "Flying Whales", receiving exposure in the UK metal press in 2006. It also confirmed the abilities of drummer Mario Duplantier. Subsequently, Gojira signed with Prosthetic Records, the label that gave them visibility in North America. The follow-up album, The Way of All Flesh (2008), marked the first time their album charted on the Billboard 200. In 2011, Gojira signed to Roadrunner Records. The band entered a period of experimentation and released two consecutive albums that reached the Top 40 on the Billboard 200, L'Enfant Sauvage (2012) and Magma (2016). Gojira would put aside their death metal in favor of concision on Magma, an album which found the band breaking through commercially, introducing their music to a wider audience. With the DIY ethic, Gojira produce their albums themselves at their own recording studios in France and New York City. Gojira have released six studio albums, three live DVDs and are the first French band to have topped the Billboard Hard Rock Albums chart in 2016. The band are considered as one of France's most successful exports in the US. Gojira have received Grammy nominations for Best Rock Album for their album Magma and Best Metal Performance for its single "Silvera". The band holds the record for the loudest concert and sound ever recorded at the Stade de France. Throughout their career, Gojira have been involved in environmental and animal defense.

We had no plan, no pressure. ... We didn't even have a [band] name".[8] By then, the Duplantier brothers were each playing in their own metal bands that they had started two years previously.[9] Both were already regarded for their abilities.[10][9] In 1996, they settled on the name Godzilla.[3][11] When making a decision on a choice for a band name, the idea came from the original 1954 Godzilla black and white film, as they appreciated "the myth of the big pissed off atomic lizard. ... It was in our heads a symbol of devastating power".[12] The band's first performance was effectuated four months after the formation,[9] playing in the bars of Bayonne.[4] They would sell cassettes at shows and to their friends.[9] Delivering a straight-ahead death metal[13] with elements of thrash metal, Godzilla self-released a pair of demo albums, Victim in 1996,[7][5] and Possessed in 1997,[7][11] and began touring in the south west of France.[14] Cornillon left the band in [January] 1998, and was replaced by Jean-Michel Labadie;[15] a "young bass player very active on the Basque scene".[2] In early 1999, Godzilla won the tremplin Ultrasons (English: Ultra Sound springboard), a regional festival aiming to encourage young emerging artists.[16] In September 1999, Godzilla supported Cannibal Corpse, Edge of Sanity, Impaled Nazarene and Immortal in France.[7][17] During the tour with Immortal their exposure spread all over the country, and they began to acquire a reputation on the French underground metal scene for their "incendiary riffs".[2] The band continued their progress and recorded Saturate, their third demo album released in the fall of 1999.[14][11] In 2000, the band released Wisdom Comes, a fourth homemade demo album.[18][11] But at the same time, they immersed themselves in the songwriting for what they intended to be their first full-length album, a project planned since 1996. Joe Duplantier said that he was inspired by Mike Oldfield, when writing the songs.[19] In 2001, legal problems forced Godzilla to change its name.[20] The band changed their name to "Gojira", the rōmaji spelling of Godzilla.[21][11] Gojira performing in Niort, France during the Terra Incognita Tour in October 2002, from left to right: Christian Andreu, Mario Duplantier, Joe Duplantier, and Jean-Michel Labadie. Enticed by the album's production quality of a metal band from Paris, Gojira moved on the spur of the moment in the same studio in Brussels to record their debut album, Terra Incognita.[8][22] Before entering the recording studio, they solicited friends and family members to support the budget through donations.[8] Although Joe Duplantier admitted that Gojira was taking a long time to compose, the recording process lasted ten days.[22][8] At this point, after completing the recording and mixing by Stephan Kraemer at Impuls Studios, Gojira had neither label, nor record company, nor management.[3][12][22] Moreover, the labels deemed them "too ambitious" for their style of music—quoted as "a real war machine"—and told them to stop death metal and sing in French. Joe Duplantier said: "[t]he door was clearly closed".[2] The band understood then that the best way to get out of the deadlock was to get structured.[23] Gojira formed their own label named Gabriel Editions, via a limited liability company, becoming autonomous and consequently able "to produce their music from A to Z".[23] To "manage the band's activities, financing everything ourselves", said Andreu.[2] In March 2001, Gojira released their debut studio album, Terra Incognita, under Gabriel Editions, which "made significant waves".[24][1] Do-it-yourself enthusiasts,[2] Gojira had a pallet of 1,500 albums delivered to Duplantier's parents' kitchen, then they went to supply a small store in Bayonne to sell them.[8][25] Subsequently, Gojira signed a contract with Sphere Management and Richard Gamba became their manager.[3][12] Promoting the release of Terra Incognita, Gojira went on a country-wide tour, sharing the stage with French death metal / thrash metal / crossover acts, such as Hertz and Silence,[26] Nihil, No Flag, Oversoul,[22] Scarve,[27] and Swiss grindcore band Nostromo, among others.[28] In July, they performed at Dour Festival in Belgium as one of the opening acts.[29] Later, they signed with the independent Boycott Records / Next Music for national distribution.[12][14][23] In November 2002, Gojira became the owner of a recording studio also home to their rehearsal room,[30] named Le Studio Des Milans, and located in the heart of the Landes forest.[2][23] Initially, the studio was a barn in ruin that they entirely rebuilt—mainly the roof and the walls,[31] over two years of work between tours and albums.[32][33] On the return on investment, Joe Duplantier stated that "[t]he budget is important for this [second] record but for the next one, it will be minimal".[23] The Link and From Mars to Sirius (2003−2007)[edit] The composition of the second studio album, The Link, would last a year.[19] Mario Duplantier said of his approach on the album that "it was a period during which I wanted to play fast: I was starting to master well the grind parts and the double bass pedal".[25] The newly purchased equipement had still not been delivered to the Studio Des Milans, while the recording start date for the album had already passed; it was hastily[25] self-produced and recorded with the band's live engineer, Laurentx Etchemendy.[19][14] The songs were conceived without delay on the vocals nor reverb. Joe Duplantier described that it was "all very raw and very honest".[19] In April 2003, Gojira released The Link, of which 2,500 were shipped to French stores,[25] via the same self-distribution as for Terra Incognita.[34][23] The Link was well received upon its release,[35] which led the band to tour across the metropolitan France (also known as the Hexagone), and beyond its borders,[36] including Bilbao, Swiss and Belgium, allowing the band to gain recognition.[37][38] In June, Gojira played at the Furyfest, buried in a lineup of hardcore bands, in a festival created before the emergence of the Hellfest Summer Open Air.[39] In March 2004, Gojira played alongside Loudblast, No Return, Scarve, The Old Dead Tree and Garwall, in a sold-out venue dedicated that night to metal bands from France at La Locomotive in Montmartre in Paris.[40][41] Renowned for their live performances, Gojira was developing a steadily growing fan base at the time.[42] A reviewer described the Gojira's concert as "timed, with millimeter precision, of a phenomenal power... With a gigantic sound! An interpretation outside the norm", adding, "the Landais cataclysm has just struck on La Locomotive".[41] In April 2004, the band released a live concert DVD of The Link Tour, titled The Link Alive,[1] which was filmed by a team of seventeen cameramen during a sold-out show with an audience of 800 in Bordeaux in 2003.[43] The Link Alive, self-produced and self-distributed, was sold voluntarily without the support of a major distributor,[1][44] and was followed by the album version limited to 500 copies.[1] In July 2004, Terra Incognita and The Link had sold 7000 and 8000 copies respectively.[45] The Link era would eventually end after a successful tour of almost two years, and facing significant financial difficulties.[46] Gojira signed with Mon Slip label, which allowed them to have a higher financial advance,[35] followed by a contract with French-based Listenable Records, in December 2004.[47] Gojira in Nantes, France during the Sirius Tour in October 2005 Gojira entered the Studio Des Milans to compose their third album, From Mars to Sirius, wanting neither pressure nor obligation, but keeping as only objectives an "irreproachable sound" and a focus on musical technicality.[35] Joe Duplantier, absorbed into the notion of other worlds and dimensions, contemplating outer space, devoted his time to reading The Celestine Prophecy as well as books by author Baird T. Spalding, and others of spiritual seekers.[19] Mario Duplantier commented that the concept behind the lyrics and the album title, written by his brother, is "an allegory of his desire to see humanity go from a destructive and masculine energy, symbolized by the warrior Mars, to an energy based rather on emotion and femininity".[48] It took seven months of work to compose the album,[35] with an overall sound reinforced by the involvement of Labadie and Andreu.[25][49] In April 2005, the band performed at the twenty-ninth edition of Le Printemps de Bourges.[50] In September 2005, Gojira released their self-produced album, From Mars to Sirius, which marked a clear evolution and received positive reviews from French music critics,[51] who called it "their masterpiece".[52] 15,000 albums were shipped to French stores.[25] The album entered the Top Albums chart in France at No. 44 where it remained for one week; it stayed in the chart for three weeks.[53][1] Following the release of the album, Gojira embarked on a tour across the country, Belgium, and Holland.[34] That year, Listenable Records re-released The Link album.[47][54] In 2006, the "surging wave Gojira" seduced London journalist Lucy Williams of Kerrang! magazine who then wrote a laudatory article about the album.[2][27] In February, the band performed a crucial concert at the Élysée Montmartre, in Paris, where a crowd of journalists had gathered for the event.[2] At the end of this month, The Link Alive DVD had sold over 5,000 copies, while From Mars to Sirius had sold between 12,000 and 13,000 copies in France alone. According to Labadie, they earned their living mainly through constant touring.[34] In May 2006, after 300 concerts in France and surrounding territories, the band signed a contract with American label Prosthetic Records—into an "exclusive licensing agreement" with Listenable Records—to help give them exposure throughout North America;[55][56] "Gojira wants to work with people whose approach is sincere. ... [the band] wants to control all stages of creation, from composition to mixing", said Labadie.[34] On 19 May 2006, Gojira performed in Brighton, their first UK show, and then forged links with England's media community after the party organized by Kerrang!.[2][57] Brothers Mario (left) and Joe Duplantier (right) during a Gojira concert at the Roskilde Festival, Denmark in 2007 Following Williams' article in Kerrang! and the consequent increase in exposure in the UK metal press, Gojira was asked to replace Mastodon at England's Download Festival 2006;[2][27] Joe Duplantier remarked that "It was a decisive concert".[2] In June, they performed on the mainstage at the Hellfest Summer Open Air in Clisson,[58] and in a series of summer festivals in Germany, England and the Scandinavian countries.[34][59] On 22 August 2006, Prosthetic Records released From Mars to Sirius in the US,[56] which led to a sudden pre-order of 5,000 copies on the label's website.[60] The US release was followed by an upload onto internet site of a cover version of "Escape" by Metallica.[61] In September, a year after its release, the album had sold over 20,000 copies in France and the same equivalent abroad.[27] In early October, Gojira and Hatesphere embarked on a co-headlining tour of the UK.[60] In November, the band performed at the European Unholy Alliance Tour, headlined by Slayer at Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy.[62] The band was included in Children of Bodom's US tour in late 2006, joining Amon Amarth and Sanctity as the openers.[63] Brandon Geist of Revolver commented that since the release of From Mars to Sirius "they have risen from virtual unknowns outside of their homeland to the single-most-buzzed-about metal band on the planet".[64] In March 2007, Listenable Records (Prosthetic Records in the US), reissued The Link with remastered audio and new booklet artwork, in North America.[65][66] The following month, the label released The Link Alive DVD in the U.S.[65] Later they supported Lamb of God on their American tour along with Trivium and Machine Head.[67] Gojira made cameo appearance in Machine Head's "Aesthetics of Hate" music video, broadcast on 5 May on MTV2's Headbangers Ball.[68][69] The band also supported Trivium on the UK dates of their European tour with Sanctity and Annihilator,[70] and made numerous festival appearances.[1] In October, Listenable Records re-released Gojira's 1997 demo album Possessed as a limited edition CD.[71] In late 2007, they took part in the Radio Rebellion Tour, featuring co-headliners Behemoth, Job for a Cowboy, and Beneath the Massacre.[72] Towards the end of the more than 220-concert tour they undertook to promote From Mars to Sirius,[73] Gojira embarked on work for the follow-up album.[72] The Way of All Flesh (2008−2011)[edit] Returning to the Studio Des Milans to pursue the songwriting of their fourth studio album, The Way of All Flesh, Gojira would reach the sound they desired at the time, influenced by incessant touring.[74][31] The album took four months to write and ended in late March 2008.[75][33] Joe Duplantier stated the album would be "more intense, more brutal, and more melodic" than its predecessor.[76] The Way of All Flesh discuss the question of life after death, he said: "That's the theme it's about death itself. ... It's also about the immortality of the soul. That's the main subject for us".[77] Commenting on his brother's lyrics, Mario Duplantier said, "each album is a state of play of his life. I can see his convictions and his emotions of the moment by listening to our music again".[48] The whole recording process lasted between April and June,[73] with drums initially recorded by Logan Mader with Joe and Mario Duplantier in Los Angeles, before they returned to the Studio Des Milans to continue working on the songs with Laurentx Etchemendy.[19][78] Mader mixed the album in Los Angeles during two weeks.[74][19] Randy Blythe from the American band Lamb of God, an active supporter of Gojira in the US, co-wrote and appeared on the song "Adoration for None".[79][31] In August, two months before the release of the album, Gojira performed "Vacuity" live for the first time, at the Rock en France Festival in Arras, as the opening act for Metallica.[80] The Way of All Flesh was released on 13 October 2008 in Europe via Listenable Records and the following day in North America through Prosthetic Records.[78] The album debuted at No. 138 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 4,200 copies in its first week of release.[81][82] It reached No. 28 on the Top Albums chart in France,[83] and No. 25 on the Suomen virallinen lista chart in Finland.[84] The album topped the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart where it stayed for one week, and a total of four weeks on the chart.[85] It reached No. 21 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart.[86] Music critic Eduardo Rivadavia wrote that the album provided "imaginative progressive headbangers [...] that were rife with technical fireworks and songwriting variety" with "few failed experiments".[87] In October, Gojira toured supporting In Flames's European headlining tour,[88] followed by North America from November to December.[89] In mid-December, The Way of All Flesh ranked No. 5 on Metal Hammer's list of the Top 50 Albums 2008,[90] and LA Weekly included the album in its list of the Top 10 Metal Albums of 2008.[91] In late January 2009, Gojira began a headlining tour to promote the album which crossed France,[92] UK and Ireland.[93] On 17 March 2009, the band's first North American headlining tour was announced. The opening bands were The Chariot and Car Bomb.[94] In June, Gojira performed after Soulfly at the Hellfest Summer Open Air.[95] In July, the band played for the fourth time at Belgium's Dour Festival,[29] at the Eurockéennes Festival in Belfort,[96] Sonisphere Festival in Barcelona,[97] Graspop Metal Meeting and other summer festival appearances.[98] Terra Incognita was re-released with bonus tracks on 24 August in Europe and 15 October in North America.[99] Gojira accompanied Metallica on their tour around US and Canada from 14 September to 12 October, performing before Lamb of God.[100] Over the years, Lamb of God front man Randy Blythe would join Gojira to sing on "Backbone" at concerts, whenever they shared the same dates.[79][101] The tour included headline dates on "off" days with support from Burst and Zoroaster.[102][103] As their popularity spread into America's metal scene, Blabbermouth.net wrote that the band "has become one of metal's most acclaimed and admired acts".[99] Following the US tour, the band returned in France for a few concerts, and then started a six-month hiatus, invoking saturation after only "five days break" since 2004.[104] Andreu performing at Bergen Calling Festival, Norway, 2011 The band's break ended earlier than expected after Gojira was announced as the opening act of Metallica's European and Russian tour in April 2010.[105] In July 2010, Gojira was included in the lineup of the rock-oriented Vieilles Charrues Festival in Brittany.[106] Performing for an audience largely unaccustomed to metal music, Gojira's "delicate mission" was to close the evening of Saturday on the Glenmor stage.[107][nb 1] Described as "more powerful" than Motörhead's concert in 2008 on the same stage, the show began with the song "Lizard Skin" with an estimated crowd of between 40,000 and 50,000 people. Twenty minutes later, between 4,000 and 5,000 participants remained.[107] Newspaper Le Télégramme claimed that "the show was of a rare sonic power. ... So brutal, that the band lost 90% of the attendance along the way". The context never discouraged the band who continued to perform "as if their lives depended on it", with a drum solo executed with "breathtaking mastery". Since Gojira's concert, metal has been gradually excluded from the Vieilles Charrues Festival.[107] In August, Gojira headlined the Rock Altitude Festival in Switzerland.[108] The band continued the promotion of the album into 2010, including dates at European festivals such as Wacken Open Air,[109] Bloodstock Open Air,[110] Brutal Assault,[111] and Pukkelpop.[112] In March 2011, Gojira had made substantial progress in the composition of the fifth album, claiming to have written almost half of it; "These songs are original and a good reflection of what we are today", said Joe Duplantier.[113] Throughout 2011, the band remained relatively private, focusing on new material, the Sea Shepherd EP, and played a handful of concerts in Europe during June and July, notably at Sonisphere Festival in France,[114] Switzerland,[115] UK, Spain and Greece.[116] The band had been free agents since the summer of 2011, after their contract with Prosthetic Records expired.[117] On 9 November 2011, Gojira was acquired by Roadrunner Records.[118][nb 2] Monte Conner said, "The band is universally recognized as one of the most talented and extreme art-metal acts on the scene today. Gojira is one of those rare bands that comes along every couple of years and takes everything you know about metal, twists it, reimagines it and comes up with something wholly unique. ... The band makes that much of an impact with its music and approach".[118] In the wake of the new contract, Gojira entered Spin Studios in New York City in November to set about recording their follow-up album.[120][117] L'Enfant Sauvage (2012−2015)[edit] Gojira's fifth studio album, L'Enfant Sauvage, was co-produced by Josh Wilbur and Joe Duplantier.[19][121] On L'Enfant Sauvage, the band juxtaposed their death metal roots with elements more ambient and sophisticated,[122] with an intent to find "the ultimate sound" on which they were working since their beginning, based on experimentation and research.[19] The title translates to The Wild Child. Joe Duplantier explained that titling the album in English inadequately encapsulated the meaning of the French term: "Sauvage is something that is not educated or something that is like free and completely free in nature. ... The idea with L'Enfant Sauvage is like with a human that would grow up in nature, raised by wolves, for example, without the influence from others and the influence from institutions or society in general".[123] The title of the album made an indirect reference to the French film The Wild Child of François Truffaut—"but it's first of all about poetry", noted Mario Duplantier.[124] In 2012, K2 Agency founder John Jackson who represented Metallica, Iron Maiden, Slayer, Mastodon,[125] and Guns N' Roses, signed Gojira to global deal for the production of their concerts abroad.[126] In March 2012, Devin Townsend and Meshuggah's Fredrik Thordendal joined Gojira to perform their collaboration track "Of Blood And Salt" supposed to appear on the Sea Shepherd EP, at the Soundwave Festival in Australia.[127][128] After the band teamed up with Volcom Entertainment, a limited edition of the 7" single containing the songs "Bleeding" and "End Of Time"—originally on Godzilla's 1997 Possessed demo, was released in a 12" vinyl packaging in North America and Europe.[129][130][nb 3] After returning from an Australian tour with Mastodon and Kvelertak,[131] Gojira began a national tour in support of the album.[124] After the many tours shared with Metallica, the band was accordingly invited to open a series of concerts of the European Black Album Tour,[132] notably at the Stade de France, the largest stadium in the country on 12 May 2012.[126] On that day, the loudness of sound during Gojira's performance was measured at 120 decibels in the corridors backstage,[133] which broke the record of the Stade de France and has remained the loudest sound ever recorded at the stadium.[126][nb 4] Commenting on Metallica's motive for taking Gojira on tour with them, James Hetfield told a reporter, "I discovered their music with From Mars to Sirius, an album that I loved. Humanly speaking, I liked them a lot. They have their feet on the ground, are intelligent, sensitive. I have immense respect for them. And then Mario is an incredible drummer".[135] In May, Gojira performed at the Sonisphere Festival headlined by Metallica, in Switzerland, Finland, and Poland.[136] The band shared two dates in France with Slayer as headliner, on 27 May in Toulouse and on 29 May in Clermont-Ferrand.[137] Mascot Label released a live DVD/Blu-ray titled The Flesh Alive on 4 June in Europe.[138][139] Gojira performing at Aalborg Metal Festival in 2012 Gojira released L'Enfant Sauvage in June 2012 on Roadrunner Records for worldwide distribution.[124] The album reached No. 34 on the Billboard 200, selling 11,000 copies in the US in its first week of release.

Film director Paul Ouazan decided to create a special performance video focused on the crowd, saying "I was immediately convinced that the band had a fifth member; its audience". It was broadcast on Arte later that month.[203] On 13 June, the band was included in the live lineup of the Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards, held at the Eventim Apollo in London.[204][57] On 16 June, the band made their first world television appearance as musical guests of the day at Le Petit Journal, performing an extract of "Silvera" in prime time on Canal+ in France.[193][205] The self-produced album,[198] Magma, was released on 17 June 2016 through Roadrunner Records.

Between the Landes, the United States and the Basque Country".[187] By 2018, Gojria was elevated to the headliner status in Europe.[245] The band performed a string of festival headline dates throughout the summer, including at Tuska Open Air Metal Festival,[246][245] Brutal Assault Open Air,[247] Into The Grave Open Air in Leeuwarden[248] and at Bloodstock Open Air.[249] In early August 2018, Gojria played to the first largest crowd of their career at Pol'and'Rock Festival in Kostrzyn nad Odrą, Poland. More than 400,000 people attended the festival.[250][251] On 8 September 2018, Nick John, manager of Gojira, Mastodon and Slayer, died from cancer. John managed Gojira since 2012.[252][253] On 16 January 2019, Gojira released on YouTube their entire set from Pol'and'Rock Festival 2018.[251] In the summer of 2019, Gojira toured the United States to support Slipknot on their Knotfest Roadshow Tour.

The song and its music video address deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. The band also established a month-long fundraiser for Brazilian indigenous rights charity Articulation of Indigenous People of Brazil (APIB).[266][267] Side projects[edit] Empalot[edit] In 1998, the Duplantier brothers formed an avant-garde metal / jazz fusion / funk rock band called Empalot,[268][269] with Joe's friends from his high school thrash metal band (P4).[270][271] Empalot consisted of nine members including two bass players, one guitarist, saxophone, keyboard, percussion and drums.[16][270][nb 7] Considered by themselves as the antithesis of Gojira, by its musical style[268] and festive side, Empalot was a project that emphasized burlesque, humor and self-mockery.[269] Mario Duplantier said that "it's funny, it's crazy. We had a blast doing it. Above all, it's a bunch of guys who share the same convictions, the same sense of humor and common values".[269] For Joe Duplantier, Empalot evoked happiness and fits of laughter.[269] A demo album called Brout was released in 1999.[269] In 2000, Empalot won the regional tremplin Ultrasons (English: Ultra Sound springboard) that highlighted local bands.[16] Their first album, Tous aux Cèpes, was released in 2002.[269][16] Empalot went on a national underground tour (albeit more regional),[272] from 1999 to 2004[270] with avant-garde metal / fusion bands from France such as Psykup.[273] An Empalot concert would attract 1000 participants in their hometown.[270] They performed in disguise and under fictitious names.[16] A live album called Empalot en Concert was released in 2004 and the band went on hiatus the same year.[269] Avec vautours[edit] In early 2003, Gojira composed the music for the short film Avec vautours (English: With vultures), by Xabi Molia, filmed in the mountains of the French Basque country.[274][275][276] Maciste all'inferno[edit] In 2003, before the release of their second album The Link,[277] Gojira received a request from Alain Marty who organized a series of film–concerts at the music school and venue, Rock School Barbey, based in a former theatre in Bordeaux.[278][43][279] Regional artists of all musical genres and styles were invited to integrate their music on pre-selected films, spanning ten days of shows.[280] Gojira composed the original instrumental music that reflected the narrative and emotional message of the entire Italian film Maciste in Hell, a black and white silent film directed by Guido Brignone, dating from 1925.[278][43][277] On 29 May 2003,[281] the band performed all these songs on two sold-out performances in a row,[75][278] in front of the film projected on a giant screen at Rock School Barbey,[43] where the audience described "the incredible performance of Mario, running from one drum kit to another".[282] Gojira's show was captured and subsequently released as an EP, titled Maciste All'Inferno, in late 2003.[1][283] For legal reasons, the video of the performance was never broadcast.[282] In a 2008 interview, Mario Duplantier expressed his hope to release a second version as an album.[75] Cavalera Conspiracy[edit] In 2007, the founding brothers of Brazilian band Sepultura, Max and Igor Cavalera, wanted to recruit a bass player for their new band, Cavalera Conspiracy.[284][31] Labadie was chosen, through Roadrunner Records, but couldn't accept the offer due to family reasons.[285][31] Joe Duplantier called Gloria Cavalera and he was invited to replace him as a bassist.[285][286] While recording with Cavalera Conspiracy in Los Angeles, Joe Duplantier met Logan Mader who would record the drum parts of The Way of All Flesh in 2008.[31] On 31 August 2007, he performed with the band at the 11th annual D-Low Memorial Show at the Marquee Theatre in Tempe, Arizona,[285][287] a concert for Dana "D-Low" Wells (Max Cavalera's stepson), killed in a car crash in 1996.[288] The album Inflikted was released in March 2008,[289] and a tour followed in mid-2008.[290] For Joe Duplantier, touring with Cavalera Conspiracy became problematic, preferring instead to concentrate on Gojira, the recording of The Way of All Flesh and its promotion. He said, "I put everything in Gojira, my whole life".[31] Sea Shepherd EP[edit] In early November 2010, Gojira entered a studio in Los Angeles with producer Logan Mader to begin recording a new non-profit four-song EP, the proceeds from which will benefit Sea Shepherd, an anti-whaling organization.[291][113] According to Joe Duplantier, the EP was going to feature guest appearances from the international metal scene, with sales expected on Gojira website "without going through traditional ways".[291] In May 2011, as a preview of the Sea Shepherd EP, Gojira released "Of Blood And Salt" appearing on a Metal Hammer UK sampler album, featuring Devin Townsend as a guest vocalist and a guest guitar solo performed by Fredrik Thordendal.[292][118] The other tracks feature Randy Blythe, Brent Hinds, Anders Fridén, Max Cavalera,[293][118] and Jonas Renkse.[294] The EP was originally intended for release from August 2011 through September 2011,[293] but the EP has yet to see a release, as the hard drive which held the recordings crashed.[295] Musical style and development[edit] Metal is a music of passionate, of musician. The baseline, is rock [music]. We come from Led Zeppelin. And then we push the limits of this music. When I was a teenager, I was fascinated by the technical and fast side of metal, and I became addicted. It's an ambiguous style, which can have a disturbing image, while being subtle and positive. —Mario Duplantier[48] Gojira's sound blends several styles.[1][218][296][297] Rooted in technical death metal,[188][51][298] Gojira combine elements of death,[218][11][299] thrash,[218][11][66] groove,[218][11] and progressive metal.[188][300][298] They have also incorporated aspects of post-metal,[207][301] avant-garde metal,[302] and math metal.[1] The band play a technical and rhythmic style of heavy metal with precision drumming along with blast beats, fast double bass-drum, unusual rhythm patterns and start-and-stop riffs.[303][300][304] Mario Duplantier has been considered "the anchor" of Gojira since the beginning of the band.[303] The albums From Mars to Sirius and The Way of All Flesh have been recognized as a "paradise for drumophiles".[303] Gojira have also been known to incorporate textured atmospheric elements into their music,[300][299] and instrumental interludes into their albums.[298][296] Gojira songs have progressive and uncommon song structures, rarely using the standard verse-chorus songwriting.[66] The vocal style is varied, using the screamed style often employed in extreme metal,[51] with the death growl style predominantly used in death metal, in addition to clean vocals and higher screams.[296][305] At times, death metal growls and clean vocals are mixed to create an aggressive but melodic effect.[296] Magma marked a significant change in Gojira's sound. Writer Remfry Dedman stated that the album "reinvented the band's signature death metal sound, introducing an accessible thread without compromising their raw intensity".[306] Influences[edit] Gojira was mainly influenced by the early albums of heavy metal artists such as Death,[307] Metallica,[307] Morbid Angel,[308] Sepultura,[307] and Tool.[307] They have also cited Led Zeppelin,[45] and Rage Against the Machine's debut album as influence.[307] Joe Duplantier cited Morbid Angel's 1993 album Covenant as "beautiful, and it's full of magic and epic brutality", and praised their 1995 album Domination.[308] Mario Duplantier credited the band Death as "an obligatory path, they are at the origin of death metal", while Andreu further noted that "It's our culture, we come from Death".[307] One of Labadie's earliest influences was Ride the Lightning by Metallica, the first metal album he listened to when he was eleven years old.[307] Joe Duplantier stated that "Ride the Lightning saved my life when I faced difficult times in high school!";[307] Duplantier has also cited Machine Head's 1994 album Burn My Eyes as an influence.[308] Their other musical influences in a lesser degree[307] include Slayer,[309] Pantera,[2] and Meshuggah.[310] The band's music has been likened to Neurosis.[51][299] In 2003, Joe Duplantier had expressed admiration for Sade.[275] By 2016, the band also mentioned Pink Floyd,[187] the Beatles,[311] Mike Oldfield,[312] and Radiohead.[311] In 2021, Joe Duplantier has also discussed how traditional rock, blues and Americana had been childhood influences "reawakened" by long conversations with Mastodon guitarist Brent Hinds, saying that "the older the other guys and I get, the more we appreciate it".[264] Andreu, Joe and Mario Duplantier described classical music as a particular inspiration.[311] Andreu said, "at 70%, I listen to classical music".[313] Commenting on Gojira's compositions, relying on syncopations and contretemps (English: on-beat and off-beat), Mario Duplantier said, Joe and I were introduced to classical very early on. In the family there was a love and an understanding for this music. There is a very strong link between metal and classical music, through the solemn side, grave, but also the attention paid to existential subjects, life and death. Pop [music] is more focused on romantic feelings.[311] The From Mars to Sirius album was the narrative of a metaphorical journey to the "ocean planet" Sirius C, as well as "a homage" to the whales and their intelligence, as evoked in the song "Flying Whales".[25] The song "The Art of Dying" from The Way of All Flesh was a Buddhist reference and features introspective lyrics.[48] Lyrical themes[edit] Gojira's lyrics tackle themes of life, death, rebirth,[310] spirituality,[314] and nature.[2][315] In particular, their 2005 album From Mars to Sirius was a concept album tackling environmental issues and broader themes of life, death, and rebirth,[11] saying "Our lyrics are indeed quite philosophical ... They are reflections on life".[48] The lyrics thematically revolve around the human being, his condition, and his place in the world.[124] Gojira are also well known for their environmentalism and have used their lyrics and music videos to highlight environmental issues such as climate change, marine pollution and deforestation of the Amazon rainforest.[316][266][317] Songs such as "Global Warming" and "Toxic Garbage Island" depicts how man has modified and altered his natural environment, flora and fauna.[318] The members of the band were raised in Ondres and Bayonne, in the south west coast of France (Pyrénées-Atlantiques / French Basque Country).[319] The rugged coastline and surrounding scenic countryside inspired Gojira's interest in nature and the ocean.[2] Mario Duplantier has said seeing oil spills in the ocean nearby inspired the band's interest in environmentalism.[320] In a 2016 interview, the Duplantier brothers said that the upbringing they had received during their youth—by a French architectural drafter / painter father, Dominique Duplantier, and a mother, Patricia, an American with Azorean roots—in a Landaise style house "lost in the forest, with no neighborhood", was reflected in Gojira's music and lyrics.[319] Mario Duplantier recalled these memories, and his mother as, A very free spirit, which has always encouraged our creativity. On the one hand, we had this extroverted mother, who drew, sculpted, made magnificent paintings out of driftwood, and on the other, a silent, 'workaholic' father, who could spend whole days on his gigantic drawings in Chinese ink, with an almost worrying rigor. These two aspects of our upbringing are found in Gojira, a mixture of discipline and something more extroverted, wacky and chaotic.[319] Activism[edit] Gojira have been frequent supporters of environmental causes.[321][322] Joe Duplantier has said if he was not a musician he would be an environmental activist with Greenpeace or Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.[323] The band cooperate with Sea Shepherd to raise money for the charity's work protecting marine animals, especially dolphins, whales, and sharks.[21][324][148] Members from the organization are allowed to run a merchandise booth at Gojira gigs[325] and the charity named a $4 million interceptor vessel after the band.[326][nb 8] In 2010, the band participated in the environment-friendly and multi-genre music festival Le Cabaret Vert in Charleville-Mézières in France whose main objective is to reduce its environmental impact.[318][331] In June 2012, Duplantier expressed the band's support for Sea Shepherd and its founder, Paul Watson, when he appeared on stage in between two Gojira songs at the Rock am Ring Festival in Germany.[332] In 2015, the band was invited to perform at the Emmaüs Lescar-Pau Festival in France, organized by the international solidarity Emmaüs movement which is committed to fighting poverty and homelessness.[333][318] Gojira's 2021 single "Amazonia" was also released as part of a month-long fundraiser for a Brazilian indigenous rights charity curated by Gojira.[266][267][nb 9] Legacy[edit] Gojira ranked sixth on Paris magazine L'Express' 2009 list of the "Top 10 best–selling French music artists in USA".[334] By 2012, according to The Cultural Services of the French Embassy in the US, Gojira had become "one of France's most famous bands", as well as the top-ranked in the metal category of the country.[335] By August 2016, the band was one of France's biggest exports in the rock category in USA.[336] In early 2017, French national newspapers agreed that Gojira had become the first metal band from the country to achieve international status,[311][337][338] and paradoxically without any support from the Institut Français which promotes French culture abroad.[337][nb 10] In October 2019, Alter Bridge's Myles Kennedy called Gojira "the most important metal band out there right now",[339] adding that "they're very important to the evolution of where things are going with hard rock and metal".[340] Mario Duplantier ranks among the top five best metal drummers in the world.[341][342] Gojira have influenced Swedish metal band Orbit Culture,[343] Jinjer,[344][345] Thy Art Is Murder,[346] Fit for an Autopsy,[347] Betraying the Martyrs,[348] The Agonist,[349] prog metal/rock band Klone,[350] Tallah's Max Portnoy,[351] and Paris' Atlantis Chronicles.[352] Vocalist and guitarist Josh Middleton of Sylosis said that his vocal approach was inspired by Gojira, stating, "when From Mars to Sirius came out, this album was huge for most people who love heavy music. ... There are a lot of very melodic screams on this album, it seems like there is always a height in his singing, and that influenced me enormously".[353] Myles Kennedy explained where he found inspiration when he composed Alter Bridge's song "Native Son"; he said, "When I wrote that riff, I had certainly been listening to a lot of Gojira".[354] Norwegian singer Aurora said she was inspired by the band's lyrics;[355] "Gojira is my favorite band of all time".[356] Jinjer's Tatiana Shmayluk and Aurora have both stated that they would like to collborate with Gojira.[357][358] Members[edit] Current members[15] Joe Duplantier − lead vocals, lead guitar (1996–present) Mario Duplantier − drums (1996–present) Christian Andreu − rhythm guitar (1996–present) Jean-Michel Labadie − bass (1998–present) Former members Alexandre Cornillon − bass (1996–1998)[15] Timeline Discography[edit] Main article: Gojira discography Studio albums Terra Incognita (2001) The Link (2003) From Mars to Sirius (2005) The Way of All Flesh (2008) L'Enfant Sauvage (2012) Magma (2016) Fortitude (2021) Awards and nominations[edit] Epiphone Revolver Golden Gods Music Awards[edit] Year Nominee / work Award Result Ref. 2013 L'Enfant Sauvage Album of the Year Nominated [163][359] Mario Duplantier Best Drummer Nominated 2016 "Silvera" Best Film/Video Won [360][361] Grammy Awards[edit] Year Nominee / work Award Result Ref. 2017 "Silvera" Best Metal Performance Nominated [233] Magma Best Rock Album Nominated Heavy Music Awards[edit] Year Nominee / work Award Result Ref. 2017 Gojira Best International Band Won [362][363] 2018 Best Live Band Won [364][365] Loudwire Music Awards[edit] Year Nominee / work Award Result Ref. 2012 L'Enfant Sauvage Metal Album of the Year Nominated [366][367] Mario Duplantier Drummer of the Year Nominated [368][369] Joe Duplantier Vocalist of the Year Nominated [370][371] 2016 Mario Duplantier Best Drummer of the Year Nominated [372] Joe Duplantier Best Vocalist of the Year Nominated Magma Best Metal Album Nominated "Silvera" Best Metal Song Nominated Gojira Best Metal Band of the Year Nominated Best Live Act Nominated 2017 Mario Duplantier Best Drummer Won [373][374] Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards[edit] Year Nominee / work Award Result Ref. 2013 Gojira Best Live Band Won [164] 2016 Joe Duplantier Dimebag Darrell Shredder Award Nominated [375][376] 2017 Magma Best Album Won [234] Rhythm/MusicRadar Awards[edit] Year Nominee / work Award Result Ref. 2016 Mario Duplantier Best Metal Drummer Won [377] Rock music portal France portal Notes[edit] ^ Earlier before this concert, newspaper Le Télégramme warned people attending the festival that "Gojira could blow up the sound barrier tonight".[106] ^ After a "fiercly" competitive bidding war between record labels.[119] ^ Originally, Volcom organized two exhibitions of Mario Duplantier's art in France.[130] ^ The loudest crowd roar at the Stade de France was measured by the sound level meter at 109 decibels, which was generated by the 80,000 participants during the 2015 Coupe de la Ligue Final.[134] ^ At the time of its release Magma scored 85 out of 100 based on 8 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.[217] ^ The band Nostromo, with whom Gojira shared the stage during the Terra Incognita Tour, were chosen as the opener for the tour run.[48][230] ^ Starring live engineer Laurentx Etchemendy (saxophone) and lighting engineer Stéphane Chateauneuf (vocals).[271] The latter appears in The Link Alive DVD's short show called "Tchang & Tanguy", also in "Love" and "To Sirius" music videos. ^ In 2010, the trimaran Ocean 7 Adventurer was purchased by Sea Shepherd and renamed MV Gojira to join "Operation No Compromise" in Antarctica.[327][328] Sea Shepherd received legal pressure from the Japanese company that oversees the Gojira / Godzilla brand.[329][330] MV Gojira was renamed MV Brigitte Bardot, in honor of the French actress and animal activist Brigitte Bardot.[330] ^ Heavy metal bands who have donated items for the auction include Sepultura, Metallica, Slayer, Lamb of God, and Bring Me the Horizon.[266] ^ Mario Duplantier noted that France "is rather a country of chansons with chanteurs à texte (French language as an instrument / dramatic singers) and it's fine like that".[187] References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i j k Buchanan, Jonathan D.
