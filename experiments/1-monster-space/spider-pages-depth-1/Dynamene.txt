Her name, a participle, means "she who can, the capable one." She, along with her sister Pherusa, was associated with the might and power of great ocean swells. She is mentioned in Homer's Iliad,[1] and Hesiod's Theogony.[2] Popular culture[edit] Dynamene is also the name of the beautiful widow in Christopher Fry's 1946 comedy A Phoenix Too Frequent, a character and plot derived from Petronius. After the premature death of her husband Virilius, Dynamene along with her maid Doto proposes to starve herself to death and follow him to Hades. They are rudely interrupted from their purpose by the handsome soldier Tegeus who is meant to be guarding six dead bodies outside. With Tegeus's charm and adoration Dynamene is able to save herself from an untimely fate.[3][relevant?] References[edit] ^ Lempriere, John.
