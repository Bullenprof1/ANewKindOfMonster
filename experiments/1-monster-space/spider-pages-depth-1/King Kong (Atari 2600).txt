Olinger for the Atari 2600 and published by Tigervision in 1982.[1] Based on the licensed King Kong character,[2] the game is a clone of the first screen of Donkey Kong.[3] It was Tigervision's first cartridge release.[3] Tiger Electronic Toys produced a handheld version, licensed to Tandy, the same year.[4] Contents 1 Gameplay 2 Reception 3 References 4 External links Gameplay[edit] The objective is to rescue the girl by climbing ladders to the top of the screen while jumping over holes and autonomous bombs.[2] Magic bombs are worth five times the points of regular bombs when jumped over. As in Donkey Kong, each level has a bonus that counts down. If it reaches zero, a life is lost. There are settings for 1 or 2 players alternating turns, slow or fast bombs, and whether magic bombs exist.[2] Reception[edit] Ed Driscoll reviewed King Kong in The Space Gamer No. 58.[5] Driscoll commented that "Overall, it's a fun-to-play game, with some good graphics. Not bad for a first cartridge!"[5] Electronic Games said, "It presents a crude imitation of Donkey Kong's first scenario and replaces the barrels and flame creatures with what look like old-fashioned toilets, some of which have lit fuses."[3] In a 4 out of 10 review, Arcade Express wrote, "This climbing game is marred by a poor rendition of the giant ape," and "King Kong is somewhat easier to play than other climbing games."[6] References[edit] ^ a b Hague, James.
