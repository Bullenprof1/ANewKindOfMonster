Annual awards show that honors achievements in motion picture marketing, especially film trailers Golden Trailer Awards Awarded for Excellence in motion picture marketing, film trailers, posters and television advertisement Country United States First awarded September 21, 1999 Founded in 1999, the Golden Trailer Awards are best known as the award show for film trailers (or, as "the Oscars of promotional clips").[1] The annual awards show also honors the best work in all areas of motion picture and video game marketing, including posters, television advertisements and other media, in 108 categories.[2] It is now "one of the most anticipated award shows of the year"[3] and its awards are "recognized internationally as the top honors in the field."[4] It has been called "the Hollywood Awards show for the post-MTV era" and by its founders as celebrating "the people who condense 120 minutes into a two-minute minor opus."[5] Contents 1 Overview 2 1990s 2.1 1999 3 2000s 3.1 2001 3.2 2002 3.3 2003 3.4 2004 3.5 2005 3.6 2006 3.7 2007 3.8 2008 3.9 2009 4 2010s 4.1 2010 4.2 2011 4.3 2012 4.4 2013 4.5 2014 4.6 2015 4.7 2016 4.8 2017 4.9 2018 4.10 2019 5 References 6 External links Overview[edit] The 1st Golden Trailer Awards ceremony was held on September 21, 1999 in New York and had 19 categories. This jury consisted of Quentin Tarantino, Stephen Wooley, Jeff Kleeman and David Kaminow (from Miramax). The cofounders, sisters Evelyn Watters and Monica Brady, promoted their inaugural festival by screening the nominated trailers inside a gold-painted Airstream trailer at the 2000 Sundance festival.[6] The ceremonies moved to Los Angeles in 2002.[7] Notable jurors in subsequent years have included Pedro Almodovar, Joel Siegel, Ben Stiller, Benicio Del Toro, Glenn Close, and Brett Ratner.[8] Even as the ceremonies have expanded to include 108 categories (show and non-show), they have made a point of remaining short (at 70 minutes) — like the works they are recognizing.[9] All editions have been broadcast online; more recent years have been televised on various networks including HDNet, ReelzChannel and Fox's MyNetworkTV.[10] Notable additions to the award list include the "Golden Fleece" award, given to the trailer that gives a bad movie the most appeal. Executive Director Evelyn Watters describes it as celebrating the "pure art of cutting";[11] Executive Producer Monica Brady describes it as recognizing "a great trailer for a movie that is not so great."[12] It has also been called "the most anticipated [award] of the evening."[13] Hosts for the awards ceremonies have included Kathy Griffin (2002), Dennis Miller (2003), Tom Green (2004), Sinbad (2008), Natasha Leggero (2011), TJ Miller (2015) and Wayne Brady (2016, 2017).[14] The award was designed by artist Jim Bachor.[15] The 9th Annual Golden Trailer Awards (broadcast as the Movie Preview Awards on MyNetworkTV),[citation needed] in 2008 were at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. The Dark Knight won three awards: Best Action, Best Summer Blockbuster Poster and Trailer of the Year[16] in the public vote held by USA Today. The 19th annual awards ceremony was held on May 31, 2018 at the Theater at Ace Hotel in Los Angeles. Michelle Buteau was host and master of ceremonies, and the presenters included Kate Flannery, Lea DeLaria, Yvette Nicole Brown, Nicole Sullivan and Missi Pyle.
