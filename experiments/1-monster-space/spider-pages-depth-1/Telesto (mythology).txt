In Greek mythology, Telesto or Telestho (/tɪˈlɛstoʊ/ Greek: Τελεστώ; English translation: "success") was an Oceanid, one of the 3,000 daughters of Titans Oceanus and Tethys. Hesiod describes her as "wearing a yellow peplos".[1] Telesto was the personification of the divine blessing or success.[2] Telesto, a moon of Saturn, discovered in 1980 by Reitsema, Smith, Larson, and Fountain, is named for her.
