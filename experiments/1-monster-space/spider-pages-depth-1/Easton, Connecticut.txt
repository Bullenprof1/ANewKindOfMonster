In 1762 a congregation called the North Fairfield Society was established, and it gradually evolved into Easton. In 1787 Weston, then including lands now defined as Easton, was incorporated out of Fairfield. The area was slow to develop because of the rough hills along the Aspetuck River, and so it was not until 1845 that what is now Easton separated from Weston. Today, half of the town's property is owned by the Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut, the major supplier of water in the area. On June 1, 1968, the deaf and blind activist Helen Keller died at the age of 87 in her Easton home, where she chose to spend her final days. Her house is still intact today and has been owned by several families since her death. The local middle school bears her name. The 2009 Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree was a 76-foot (23 m) Norway Spruce donated from a private residence in Easton.

Bridge issues[edit] The Route 59 bridge in Easton, which carries more than 10,000 cars and trucks every day over the Mill River, has a substructure rated in critical condition by state safety inspectors. As of early August 2007, the bridge was one of 12 in the southwestern part of the state (including New Haven) with safety inspection ratings so low they are considered to be in critical condition. The ratings for these bridges were worse than the I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis, which collapsed during rush hour on August 1, 2007.[22] Notable people[edit] Anne Baxter, actress.[23] Phoebe Brand, blacklisted actress Elise Broach, children's book author Morris Carnovsky, actor Hume Cronyn, actor[23] Debrah Farentino, actress and journalist Edna Ferber, playwright and novelist[23] Eileen Fulton, TV actress [23] Helen Keller, blind and deaf author, the town middle school is named in her honor.[23] James Prosek, painter and author Dan Rather, CBS News anchor[23][24] Igor Sikorsky, aircraft designer[23] Jessica Tandy, actress [23] Ida M.

This provides staffing in the Fire House 24 hours a day 365 days a year. Many times during the workweek, due to Easton being a bedroom community, the "on-duty" firefighters are at times, the only ones responding to calls. In addition to their other duties, the career firefighters perform the crucial task of maintaining the Town’s firefighting equipment. ^ "Archived copy". Archived from the original on 2010-05-10.
