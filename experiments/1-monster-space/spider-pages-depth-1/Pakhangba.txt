The kingdom of Manipur had a set of two flags, a white one and a red one. All featured the Pakhangba dragon in the centre, although not as prominently in the latter flags.[11] Description[edit] Main article: Nongshaba The Pakhangba is the supreme God. He is a man who can change his body to any form, like animals, and others as he is a powerful God. In certain sculptures, known as Kangla-Sa, at the citadel of the Kangla Palace in Imphal, there is a related type of creature represented with a short body. The sculptures are large and were built of brick, standing at each side of the northern gate. They have a similar head and four sturdy legs, but their body is shorter and bears more of a resemblance to a lion. In 1891, during the Anglo-Manipur War five British officers were executed by Manipuri soldiers below these two Kangla-Sa. The act was a kind of magic ritual in which the blood of the white officers was seen as feeding there in order to weaken British power. For this act Major Maxwell, the Political Agent that was appointed after the war, had destroyed the two kangla-sa with gunpowder following the conquest of Manipur.[12] Poubi Lai Paphal: a mythical form of Pakhangba Lit Pakhangba statue in Imphal Two standing Kangla-Sa at the northern gate of Kangla Fort. These massive statues have been rebuilt after they were destroyed at the end of the Anglo-Manipur war of 1891.
