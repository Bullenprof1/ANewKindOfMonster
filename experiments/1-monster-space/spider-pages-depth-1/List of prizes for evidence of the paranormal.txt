A pre-test of the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge during TAM 2012.[1] Paranormal challenges, often posed by groups or individuals who self-identify as skeptics or rationalists, publicly challenge those who claim to possess paranormal abilities to demonstrate that they in fact possess them, and are not fraudulent or self-deceptive.[2] Contents 1 Process 2 History 3 List of standing prizes 4 List of defunct prizes 5 See also 6 References 7 Further reading Process[edit] Play media The Czech Skeptics' Club Sisyfos offers €125,000 to anyone who can prove paranormal phenomena.[3] After establishing procedures and measures of success agreed upon beforehand between the challengers and the claimants, a challenge is usually divided into two steps, the first being a "preliminary test" or "pre-test", where claimants can show their purported abilities under controlled conditions before a small audience, before being admitted to the final test. Sometimes these pre-tests have a smaller prize attached to them.[4] Several local organisations have set up challenges that serve as pre-tests to larger prizes such as the JREF's One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge[1][5][6] or the 2012–2013 SKEPP Sisyphus Prize (for one million euros).[7][8] History[edit] In 1922, Scientific American made two US$2,500 offers: (1) for the first authentic spirit photograph made under test conditions, and (2) for the first psychic to produce a "visible psychic manifestation."[9] Harry Houdini was a member of the investigating committee. The first medium to be tested was George Valiantine, who claimed that in his presence spirits would speak through a trumpet that floated around a darkened room. For the test, Valiantine was placed in a room, the lights were extinguished, but unbeknownst to him his chair had been rigged to light a signal in an adjoining room if he left his seat. Because the light signals were tripped during his performance, Valiantine did not collect the award.[2] Since then, many individuals and groups have offered similar monetary awards for proof of the paranormal in an observed setting.[2] Indian rationalist Abraham Kovoor's challenge in 1963 inspired American skeptic James Randi's prize in 1964,[10] which became the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge. In 2003, these prizes were calculated to have a combined value of US$2,326,500.[11] As of January 2015[update], none of the prizes have been awarded. The James Randi paranormal challenge was officially terminated in 2015.[12] As of 2018, these prizes combine to approximately US$1,024,215. However, they take place in multiple countries and the conditions to be met may vary considerably.
