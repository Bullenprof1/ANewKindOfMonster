Whitehall was first called "Skenesborough" in 1759 when it was settled by a land grant to a British officer, Philip Skene (1725-after 1785), who later returned to England, and who was subsequently declared an enemy of the State of New York for his land dealings. During the French and Indian War, the town was one of two major routes connecting the English and French Colonies. During the American Revolution, the village, Skenesborough, was captured by American forces in 1774. Benedict Arnold under Philip Schuyler built a fleet of vessels to confront British forces at Valcour Island (thus the claim that this is the birthplace of the U.S. Navy). The surviving American vessels returned here to be destroyed in order to keep them from falling into enemy hands. The next year John Burgoyne led his forces through this area en route to the Battle of Saratoga. After the war, the town's name was changed to Whitehall. During the War of 1812 the area was used to build ships to battle British forces on Lake Champlain, culminating at the Battle of Plattsburgh. In 1823, the Champlain Canal was completed to Whitehall. The Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad was extended to Whitehall in 1848. During the second half of the 19th Century, the silk industry grew important in the town. Due to the actions in 1775-76, the legislature of the State of New York in 1960 declared Whitehall to be the birthplace of the United States Navy.[5] See also[edit] Saratoga Campaign, War of 1812 Geography[edit] The South Bay of Lake Champlain near Whitehall According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 58.8 square miles (152.2 km2), of which, 57.6 square miles (149.2 km2) of it is land and 1.1 square miles (3.0 km2) of it (1.94%) is water.
