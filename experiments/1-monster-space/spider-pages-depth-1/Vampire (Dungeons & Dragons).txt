A humanoid or monstrous humanoid creature can become a vampire, and looks as it did in life, with pale skin, haunting red eyes, and a feral cast to its features. A new vampire is created when another vampire drains the life out of a living creature. Its depiction is related to those in 1930s and 1940s Hollywood Dracula and monster movies.[1] In writing vampires into the game, as with other creatures arising in folklore, the authors had to consider what elements arising in more recent popular culture should be incorporated into their description and characteristics.[2] Contents 1 Publication history 1.1 Dungeons & Dragons (1974–1976) 1.2 Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 1st edition (1977–1988) 1.3 Dungeons & Dragons (1977–1999) 1.4 Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition (1989–1999) 1.5 Dungeons & Dragons 3.0 edition (2000–2002) 1.6 Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 edition (2003–2007) 1.7 Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition (2008–2014) 2 Description 3 Vampire spawn 4 Variant vampires 5 In Oriental Adventures 6 Notable vampires 7 Reception 8 Other publishers 9 References 10 Further reading Publication history[edit] The vampire was one of the earliest creatures introduced in the Dungeons & Dragons game.

Description[edit] A vampire can be of any evil alignment, and if its alignment was not evil in life it becomes so in undeath. A vampire retains all the abilities it had in life, and gains the ability to drain blood and life energy, and to dominate other creatures with its gaze. A vampire can also command rats, bats, and wolves, or take the form of those creatures. They also become superhumanly strong, can heal quickly or even regenerate, and can turn into a gaseous form. Some vampires worship the god Kanchelsis. Vampire spawn[edit] Vampire Spawn Information Type Undead Alignment Any Evil In the Dungeons and Dragons game, the vampire spawn are undead creatures created when a vampire slays a mortal with its bite. Vampire spawn look much the way they did in life (they are usually humanoids), except with hardened features and a predatory look. They also have greyer skin. A vampire spawn can become a normal vampire after drinking the blood of the vampire who originally turned them into a vampire spawn. A vampire spawn is controlled by the vampire who created them. Vampire spawn are similar in their habits to vampires, being evil creatures drawn to their graves and coffins. They are much more brutish, stupid and while still strong, are physically weaker than vampires. They cannot turn into a bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf and they cannot summon rats, bats or wolves. Vampire spawn are unable to create spawn of their own. They attack by hammering opponents against walls, punching them, and tearing out their limbs. They can both energy drain, and suck the blood with a bite. Their mere gaze drains the victim of confidence, courage, energy, hope and joy. Vampire spawn have the ability to assume a gaseous form. They can also climb upon walls in the manner of a spider. Vampire spawn are, however, also vulnerable to all normal attacks and spells which repel vampires. Vampire spawn speak Common. They can be of any evil alignment. In the Dungeons & Dragons supplement Libris Mortis, vampire spawn, along with several other undead creatures became character classes for player characters. Variant vampires[edit] Moonbane Vampire – a vampire vulnerable to the light of the full moon. Monstrous Vampire – a non-humanoid vampire. Persuasive Vampire – uses the power of its speech to sway opinions of listeners. Psychic Vampire – drains a victim's mental strength rather than physical health. Savage Vampire – rely on brute force and hunt in packs. Swarmform Vampire – can assume the form of a swarm of creatures. Vampiric Dragon – vampiric dragon forever anchored to its hoard, much like a normal vampire craves its coffin. It can overcome this weakness through the use of magical trinkets, such as chokers, wrist bands and other pieces of jewelry that contains their entire horde. Most notable of these was Brimstone the Smoke drake's great diamond choker which allowed him to travel any length from his lair whenever he wanted so long as it was at night. In Oriental Adventures[edit] Hopping Vampire – Arises when a body is buried improperly or in an inauspicious location. Penanggalan – A floating head, with entrails and intestines hanging down from the neck, which it can wrap around throats and limbs to squeeze the life out of its victims before feeding on their blood. Notable vampires[edit] Strahd von Zarovich originally of the I6:Ravenloft adventure module and later made part of the Ravenloft Campaign Setting. Union of Eclipses – A powerful and influential cabal of vampires whose dominion spans multiple worlds of the Material Plane. Vlad Tolenkov – A sometimes consort to and advisor of Lolth, he resides in a Nightmare World trapped in the Demonweb Pits. Drelzna – The vampire daughter of the archmage Iggwilv, she was trapped in stasis as the guardian of the main treasure in The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth. Reception[edit] Rob Bricken of io9 identified the vampire as one of "The 12 Most Obnoxious Dungeons & Dragons Monsters".[25] Detlef Wienecke-Janz and James Lovitt considered the vampire a typical monster of the Bram Stoker-inspired horror-setting of Ravenloft.[26][27] Other publishers[edit] The vampire is fully detailed in Paizo Publishing's book Classic Horrors Revisited (2009), on pages 46–51.[28] References[edit] ^ Weinstock, Jeffrey, ed.
