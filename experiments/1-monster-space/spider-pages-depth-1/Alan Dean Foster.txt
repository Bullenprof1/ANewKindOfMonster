He is a cousin of singer Lesley Gore. Foster also holds state records and one world record in senior powerlifting.[citation needed] Writings[edit] Foster has written a number of science fiction novels set in the Humanx Commonwealth, an interstellar ethical/political union of species including mankind and the insectoid Thranx. Many of these novels feature Philip Lynx ("Flinx"), an empathic young man who has found himself involved in something which threatens the survival of the Galaxy. Flinx's constant companion since childhood is a minidrag named Pip, a flying, empathic snake capable of spitting a highly corrosive and violently neurotoxic venom. His fantasy series Spellsinger features a young musician who is summoned into a world populated by talking creatures where his music allows him to do real magic whose effects depends on the lyrics of the popular songs he sings (although with unpredictable results). Many of Foster's works have a strong ecological element to them, often with an environmental twist.[citation needed] Often the villains in his stories experience their downfall because of a lack of respect for other alien species or seemingly innocuous bits of their surroundings. This can be seen in such works as Midworld, about a semi-sentient planet that is essentially one large rainforest, and Cachalot, set on an ocean world populated by sentient cetaceans. Foster usually devotes a large part of his novels to descriptions of the strange environments of alien worlds and the coexistence of their flora and fauna. Perhaps the most extreme example of this is Sentenced to Prism, in which the protagonist finds himself trapped on a world where life is based on silicon rather than carbon, as on Earth. Star Wars[edit] Foster was the ghostwriter of the original novelization of Star Wars, which was credited solely to George Lucas.[2] When asked if it was difficult for him to see Lucas get all the credit for Star Wars, Foster said, "Not at all. It was George's story idea. I was merely expanding upon it. Not having my name on the cover didn't bother me in the least. It would be akin to a contractor demanding to have his name on a Frank Lloyd Wright house."[3] Foster also wrote the follow-up novel Splinter of the Mind's Eye (1978), written with the intention of being adapted as a low-budget sequel to Star Wars if the film was unsuccessful. However, Star Wars was a blockbusting success, and The Empire Strikes Back (1980) would be developed instead. Foster's story relied heavily on abandoned concepts that appeared in Lucas's early treatments for the first film.[4] Foster returned to the franchise for the prequel-era novel The Approaching Storm (2003), and also wrote the novelization of the first sequel trilogy film, The Force Awakens (2015).[5] Star Trek[edit] Foster has the story credit for Star Trek: The Motion Picture.[6] He also wrote 10 books based on episodes of the animated Star Trek, the first six books each consisting of three linked novella-length episode adaptations, and the last four being expanded adaptations of single episodes that segued into original story. In the mid-seventies, he wrote original Star Trek stories for the Peter Pan-label Star Trek audio story records. He later wrote the novelization of the 2009 film Star Trek, his first Star Trek novel in over 30 years.[7] He later wrote the novelization for Star Trek's sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness.[8] Dispute with Disney[edit] In 2020, Foster accused (via the SFWA) The Walt Disney Company, which acquired rights to his old Star Wars novels via their 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm as well as rights to the Alien Franchise via their 2019 purchase of 20th Century Fox, of not paying him royalties for ebook sales of his books.[9][10][11] Awards[edit] Foster won the 2008 Grand Master award from the International Association of Media Tie-In Writers.[12] Bibliography[edit] Humanx Commonwealth Universe[edit] Pip and Flinx[edit] Novels are listed in chronological order of the story (not chronological order of publication). Foster comments, in a foreword to a re-issued edition of Bloodhype, that it is the eleventh novel in the series, and should fall between Running from the Deity and Trouble Magnet.[13] For Love of Mother-Not (1983) ISBN 0-345-30511-6 The Tar-Aiym Krang (1972) ISBN 0-345-29232-4 Orphan Star (1977) ISBN 0-345-25507-0 The End of the Matter (1977) ISBN 0-345-25861-4 Flinx in Flux (1988) ISBN 0-345-34363-8 Mid-Flinx (1995) ISBN 0-345-38374-5 Reunion (2001) ISBN 0-345-41867-0 Flinx's Folly (2003) ISBN 0-345-45038-8 Sliding Scales (2004) ISBN 0-345-46156-8 Running from the Deity (2005) ISBN 0-345-46159-2 Bloodhype (1973) ISBN 0-345-25845-2 Trouble Magnet (2006) ISBN 0-345-48504-1 Patrimony (2007) ISBN 978-0-345-48507-6 Flinx Transcendent (2009) ISBN 978-0-345-49607-2 Strange Music (2017) ISBN 978-1-101-96760-7 Founding of the Commonwealth[edit] Phylogenesis (1999) ISBN 0-345-41862-X Dirge (2000) ISBN 0-345-41864-6 Diuturnity's Dawn (2002) ISBN 0-345-41865-4 Icerigger Trilogy[edit] Icerigger (1974) ISBN 0-345-23836-2 Mission to Moulokin (1979) ISBN 0-345-27676-0 The Deluge Drivers (1987) ISBN 0-345-33330-6 Standalone Commonwealth novels[edit] In chronological order: Nor Crystal Tears (1982) ISBN 0-345-29141-7 Voyage to the City of the Dead (1984) ISBN 0-345-31215-5 Midworld (1975) ISBN 0-345-35011-1 "The Emoman" (1972) short story "Surfeit" (1982) short story Drowning World (2003) ISBN 0-345-45035-3 Quofum (2008) ISBN 978-0-345-49605-8 "Mid-Death" (2006) short story The Howling Stones (1997) ISBN 0-345-38375-3 Sentenced to Prism (1985) ISBN 0-345-31980-X Cachalot (1980) ISBN 0-345-28066-0 The Damned Trilogy[edit] A Call to Arms (1991) ISBN 0-345-35855-4 The False Mirror (1992) ISBN 0-345-35856-2 The Spoils of War (1993) ISBN 0-345-35857-0 Dinotopia Universe[edit] Dinotopia Lost (1996) ISBN 1-57036-279-3 The Hand of Dinotopia (1997) ISBN 1-57036-396-X Journeys of the Catechist[edit] Carnivores of Light and Darkness (1998) ISBN 0-446-52132-9 Into the Thinking Kingdoms (1999) ISBN 0-446-52136-1 A Triumph of Souls (2000) ISBN 0-446-52218-X Marexx[edit] Builder (unpublished)[14][15] Spellsinger series[edit] Spellsinger (1983) ISBN 0-446-97352-1 The Hour of the Gate (1984) ISBN 0-446-90354-X The Day of the Dissonance (1984) ISBN 0-446-32133-8 The Moment of the Magician (1984) ISBN 0-446-32326-8 The Paths of the Perambulator (1985) ISBN 0-446-32679-8 The Time of the Transference (1986) ISBN 0-932096-43-3 Son of Spellsinger (1993) ISBN 0-446-36257-3 Chorus Skating (1994) ISBN 0-446-36237-9 "Serenade" (2004), a novelette set immediately after The Time of the Transference,[16] was first published in the anthology Masters of Fantasy and was later reprinted in Foster's short story collection Exceptions to Reality.[17] The Taken trilogy[edit] Lost and Found (2004) ISBN 0-345-46125-8 The Light-Years Beneath My Feet (2005) ISBN 0-345-46128-2 The Candle of Distant Earth (2005) ISBN 0-345-46131-2 The Tipping Point trilogy[edit] The Human Blend (2010) ISBN 978-0-345-51197-3[18] Body, Inc.
