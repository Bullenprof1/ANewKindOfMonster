Subsequent critics consider them part of the Cthulhu Mythos, but often split this into the original "Lovecraft Mythos" and the later and lesser "Derleth Mythos".[1] Unknown authorship[edit] The Inevitable Conflict. This was published in Amazing Stories (December 1930 and January 1931) under the name P. H. Lovering. A variety of evidence, including statistical analysis of the writing structure, has been put forward to suggest that Lovecraft was not the author.[2] Juvenilia[edit] "The Alchemist" (1908 / November 1916) "The Beast in the Cave" (Spr 1904–21 Apr 1905 / June 1918) "The Haunted House" (<1902; unpublished, nonextant) "John, the Detective" (<1902; unpublished, nonextant) "The Little Glass Bottle" (c. 1898–9 / 1959) "The Mysterious Ship" (1902 / 1959) "The Mystery of the Grave-Yard" (c. 1898–9 / 1959) "The Noble Eavesdropper" (1897; unpublished, nonextant) "The Picture" (1907; unpublished, nonextant) "The Secret of the Grave" (<1902; unpublished, nonextant, may simply be "The Mystery of the Grave-Yard") "The Secret Cave, or John Lees Adventure" (c. 1898–9 / 1959) Poetry[edit] Lovecraft's poem "Hallowe'en in a Suburb" was cover-featured on the September 1952 Weird Tales Lovecraft's complete poetry is collected in S.T.

Lovecraft and August Derleth", were in fact written almost entirely by Derleth. In most cases, the stories were based on one or more ideas noted in Lovecraft's Commonplace Book; for example, "The Fisherman of Falcon Point" was based on this entry: "Fisherman casts his net into the sea by moonlight—what he finds." Plotting, description, dialogue, characterization, and other elements were entirely by Derleth. As such they cannot be classified as works by Lovecraft. In some instances Derleth incorporated actual prose passages by Lovecraft into his stories. The Lurker at the Threshold (a 50,000-word novel) contains about 1,200 words by Lovecraft, most of it taken from a fragment entitled "Of Evill Sorceries Done in New England" (see B-i-42), the balance from a fragment now titled "The Rose Window" (see B-ii-322). "The Survivor" was based on a comparatively lengthy plot sketch plus random notes for the story jotted down by Lovecraft in 1934. A descriptive passage of "The Lamp of Alhazred" was based on a portion of a letter by Lovecraft to Derleth, November 18, 1936. These extracts or paraphrases, however, have not been deemed significant enough to merit inclusion in this bibliography. ^ "Did Lovecraft write The Inevitable Conflict? by W. E.
