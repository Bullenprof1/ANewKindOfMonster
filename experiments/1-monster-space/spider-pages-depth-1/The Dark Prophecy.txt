They are rescued from a group of attacking blemmyae by Hemithea and invited into the Waystation, in the Indianapolis Union Station, where Apollo recalls answering to Hemithea’s prayer back when she was a Greek princess and turning Hemithea into a goddess, only to have his gift rejected when she joined the Hunters of Artemis. He learns that she is in a relationship with Josephine and the two of them have sacrificed their immortality as Hunters for love and are living as mortals. Their adopted daughter Georgina went missing after searching for the Oracle of Trophonius to receive a prophecy to prevent the Emperor Commodus from taking their griffins. Instead, she receives a message that damages her mind and causes her to wander away. Britomartis, the goddess of nets and owner of the Waystation, issues Apollo and Calypso a quest to rescue the griffins stolen by Commodus. The duo manages to rescue the griffins but is cornered by Lityerses, Commodus' man, the son of King Midas. Meg McCaffrey arrives just in time and duels with Lityerses until Apollo releases the rest of the caged animals. Apollo then picks up Meg on his griffin while Lityerses is trampled, and the three go to the Waystation. Apollo, Leo, and Meg head to Commodus's lair and free all the captured animals and prisoners, including Georgina. They search for the Throne of Memory and find it, but they are discovered by Commodus. They manage to escape with the help of Festus and the Huntresses of Artemis and rescue Lit, who was to be executed. They take everyone back to the Waystation, where Georgina relays a recorded message instead of a prophecy by Trophonius, who is revealed to be Apollo's son. He refers to Georgina as a sister, leading everyone to believe she is Apollo's daughter. Apollo and Meg decide to travel to the Oracle for the prophecy, while the rest defend the Waystation. At the Oracle, Apollo drinks from both the River of Memory and of Forgetfulness to prepare himself for taking the prophecy, but which also makes him lose his sanity for the time being. Meg sings a song of her sorrows which jogs Apollo back to reality and awakens the spirit of Trophonius. Apollo pleads with Trophonius to take him instead of Meg, to which Trophonius agrees in return for a wish, but gives her the prophecy anyway. Apollo performs CPR on Meg and destroys the Oracle, fulfilling Trophonius's wish. Peaches the karpoi and his friends drive them to the Waystation in time for battle. Apollo finds Commodus fighting Josephine, Calypso, Lit, and Thalia while holding Leo, Hemithea, and Georgina hostage. Apollo feels a surge of godly strength inside him and warns Commodus to stand down. Commodus does not pay heed to Apollo's words. Apollo manages to reveal his true divine form, blinding Commodus and his men. Meg reveals a prophecy in the form of a Shakespearan sonnet, which tells them that they must warn Camp Jupiter of an attack in five days and will have to travel in the Labyrinth with the assistance of a satyr. Meg summons the closest satyr using her powers, who turns out to be Grover Underwood.[2] Characters[edit] Main article: List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan There once was a god named Apollo Who plunged in a cave, blue and hollow Upon a three seater The bronze fire eater Was forced death and madness to swallow Prophecy given to Apollo and Meg by the Grove of Dodona in The Hidden Oracle, which refers to the events of The Dark Prophecy.[2] Apollo / Lester Papadopoulos: The main protagonist.

Preeja Aravind of The Free Press Journal opined that the book appeals to Riordan's already established fantasy, with the old characters showing development. While stating the book is a standalone, Aravind recommends reading the predecessor first.[30] Gillian P. of Pikes Peak Library District's Teen Team felt otherwise, rating the book 5/5 and called it "every bit as good as the first book", highly recommending it to fans of Percy Jackson & the Olympians and The Heroes of Olympus.[31] One topic frequently noted in by critics is the characters and their development. Carrie R. Wheadon of Common Sense Media praises the addition of characters such as the ex-immortal couple Emmie and Jo as a way to increase depth. She notes that this novel is more an exploration of other characters and their relationships to Apollo than it is about the god himself.[29] Karen Rought of Hypable states that the author's continued introduction of diverse characters feels completely natural and is never forced, writing it "feels like a truer snapshot of the world than most books ever attempt to display". She finds the relationship between Apollo and Calypso particularly interesting.[14] Pamela Kramer, former National Book Reviewer for Examiner.com, praised the characterization of Apollo as well, calling him "the brightest sun of all." She appreciated Riordan's choice to make the god bisexual.[32] However, not all reviewers thought this character development benefitted the novel. Reviewers were divided on the subject of the novel's quick pacing. Wheadon of Common Sense Media criticizes the fast-paced action, stating that it causes the reader to forget important details.[29] In contrast, The Times of India compliments the pacing and writes that it gives the reader time to stop and think about the contrast between immortality and a meaningful life.[33] Hypable's review praises how Riordan manages instill humor in even tough situations.[14] Writing for Young Adult Books Central, Karen Yingling agrees. She rates the book 5/5, appreciating how the descriptions of random facts not important to the plot adds humor. She also appreciates "his inclusion of very obscure mythological characters, and the way that he manages to work their mythological story into his own."[34] The AudioFile magazine lauded the audiobook narration, writing, "Narrator Robbie Daymond is perfectly tuned in as events take a darker turn in this sequel to The Hidden Oracle.... There's plenty of adventure and humor here, and listeners will finish this installment already eager for the next one".[35] The novel was nominated for Best Middle Grade & Children's Book of 2017 in the Goodreads Choice Awards, and ended in second place, behind The Ship of the Dead, also written by Riordan.[36] Sequel[edit] The third book of The Trials of Apollo is titled The Burning Maze and was announced by Riordan on October 17, 2017. It released on May 1, 2018.[37] See also[edit]  Children and Young Adult Literature portal References[edit] ^ "Percy Jackson author Rick Riordan releases second book in The Trials of Apollo series".
