Meanwhile, the Elias sisters, Moll and Lora, survey the destruction and enlist the help of three children, who had discovered and befriended a strange little creature dubbed "Ghogo" to help find the mysterious treasure of Nirai Kanai, an ancient lost civilization, to save the Earth from the declining environment. Along the way, the Elias tell the children the source of the Barem is a monster called Dagahra, which Nirai Kanai created to manage pollution, but went wrong. Their ally Mothra Leo, can defeat it, but will need to find a hidden treasure in Nirai Kanai's lost castle first. Meanwhile, the Elias' vengeful sister, Belvera, manipulates two fishermen to help her get the treasure first. Both parties journey to the castle, which rises from underneath the ocean upon their arrival. Awakened by an increase in pollution levels, Dagahra releases a swarm of Barem into the sea, killing numerous forms of sea life. Moll and Lora call Leo, who nearly succeeds in defeating Dagahra until the sea monster takes the battle underwater and incapacitates him with Barem. Leo lands on the newly raised Nirai Kanai temple, but before Dagahra can kill him, the structure activates and defends Leo. With its opponent powerless, Dagahra goes on a rampage. Inside the temple, Moll, Lora, and the children attempt to find the treasure while Belvera and her thralls try to thwart their mission. After stealing jewels they had found, the fishermen inadvertently unlock a gateway and awaken the Princess of Nirai Kanai, who tells the Elias sisters that Earth must be protected and saved, the children are the hope of future generations, and reveals Ghogo is the lost treasure. Moll and Lora use Ghogo's energy to revive Leo and transform him into Rainbow Mothra, allowing him to destroy the Barem covering his body. Rainbow Mothra engages Dagahra and overpowers him until the latter retreats into the sea, where Rainbow Mothra transforms into Aqua Mothra. His new form allows him to defeat Dagahra by splitting into a swarm of miniature Aqua Mothras and enter the monster's body to destroy the Barem, causing Dagahra to self-destruct. As the temple begins to collapse, Moll and Lora fly to safety on their pet miniature Mothra, Fairy, while Belvera relinquishes control of the fishermen, who help the children escape. The Princess raises Dagahra's body and places it in the temple before lowering it back into the sea while Aqua Mothra reverts to Rainbow Mothra.
