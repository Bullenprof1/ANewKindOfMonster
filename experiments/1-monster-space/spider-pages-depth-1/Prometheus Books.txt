This act is often used as a metaphor for bringing knowledge or enlightenment.[3][4] Prometheus Books publishes a range of books, focusing on topics such as science, freethought, secularism, humanism, and skepticism. It has published in the "atheism" category since its founding in 1969, and is considered the "grandfather" of atheist publishing in America.[5] Their headquarters was located in Amherst, New York, and they publish worldwide. Jonathan Kurtz is executive editor of Prometheus, which is an imprint of Globe Pequot Press.[6] The publisher has roughly 1,700 books currently in print [7] and publishes approximately 95–100 books per year.[8] Since its founding, Prometheus Books has published more than 2,500 books.[9] Contents 1 Imprints 2 Lawsuits 3 Notable authors published 4 Partnerships and Sale 5 References 6 External links Imprints[edit] Prometheus Books obtained the bulk of the books and manuscripts of Humanities Press International in 1998.[10][11] It has been building and expanding this into a scholarly imprint named Humanity Books. This imprint publishes academic works across a wide spectrum of the humanities and is now distributed by the academic division of Rowman & Littlefield.[12] In March 2005, Prometheus Books launched the science fiction and fantasy imprint Pyr.[13] In October 2012 it launched the crime fiction imprint Seventh Street Books.[14] In 2018, it sold both imprints.[15] Lawsuits[edit] Prometheus has been involved in two "major libel lawsuits." [16] In 1992 Uri Geller sued Victor J. Stenger and Prometheus Books for libel over his book Physics and Psychics.[17] The suit was dismissed and Geller was required to pay more than $20,000 in costs to the defendant.[18] Geller also sued Prometheus for publishing The Truth About Uri Geller [19] by James Randi, a book that he claimed was defamatory.[20][21] Notable authors published[edit] Some notable authors and books published by Prometheus include: Steve Allen Meeting of Minds : The Complete Scripts, With Illustrations, of the Amazingly Successful PBS-TV Series [22] Steve Allen on the Bible, Religion and Morality [23] Dumbth: The Lost Art of Thinking With 101 Ways to Reason Better & Improve Your Mind [24] Molefi Asante Isaac Asimov Election Day 2084: A Science Fiction Anthology on the Politics of the Future [25] The Roving Mind [26] The Tyrannosaurus Prescription: And 100 Other Essays [27] Past, Present and Future[28] Jeremy Bentham Rob Boston Why the Religious Right Is Wrong About Separation of Church and State [29] Taking Liberties: Why Religious Freedom Doesn't Give You the Right to Tell Other People What to Do [30] Ludwig Feuerbach Antony Flew R.
