He always had his mother and father with him on the set, but he was just about to have his 21st birthday. So we went out on location on purpose, so that he could get out from underneath their jurisdiction and see some girls here and there. So we made the picture in Baja, California, and Roddy was no virgin after that." [4] References[edit] ^ KILLER SHARK. State Library of New South Wales. Pathé. Monogram Pictures. December 16, 1950.
