Miller: Meticulously Ridiculous, which was filmed in Miller's native Denver at the end of his 2016 Meticulously Ridiculous Tour.[20] In October 2017, Miller began his "Touring In Perpetuity Tour", a self described "One Man Philosophy Circus."[21] Television[edit] Miller appeared frequently as a member of the "round table" on Chelsea Lately. He appeared as Marmaduke Brooker in Carpoolers, which ran for 13 episodes on ABC in 2007–2008. In 2012, he voiced Robbie Valentino on the Disney channel cartoon Gravity Falls. On December 13, 2010, October 28, 2011, and June 14, 2012, he performed stand-up on Conan. On November 15, 2011, his stand-up special No Real Reason premiered on Comedy Central. In 2011, he hosted a special called Mash Up, which was picked up in 2012 for a full season by Comedy Central.[22][23] He starred in the Fox TV series The Goodwin Games as Jimmy Goodwin.[24] Miller starred in the HBO sitcom Silicon Valley, which has been met with widespread critical acclaim and he won the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 2015. In May 2017, Miller and HBO jointly announced that Miller would not be returning for the 5th season of Silicon Valley.[25][26][27] As a commercial actor, he voiced a talking ball of mucus in commercials for Mucinex[19] and starred as Greg the Genie in a promotional campaign for Slim Jim meat snacks.[28] He voiced Gorburger, a giant blue monster talk show host, on The Gorburger Show, which originally aired on Funny or Die and YouTube for 2 seasons in 2012–13, then on Comedy Central for a 3rd season in 2017 before being cancelled. Film[edit] In Cloverfield, Miller's film debut, he appeared onscreen for only a few minutes, but his voice was heard in almost every scene as the character who videotaped most of the events depicted. In 2009, he played Cessna Jim in The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard and the dim-witted grindcore musician Rory in Mike Judge's comedy Extract. In 2010, he co-starred in She's Out of My League as Stainer, played Brian the Concierge in Get Him to the Greek and appeared in a supporting role in the film Unstoppable.[5] He voiced the character 'Tuffnut' in the Oscar-nominated animated films How to Train Your Dragon and How to Train Your Dragon 2. He also played Dan in Gulliver's Travels, released in December 2010. He played the supporting character of Ranger Jones in the live-action/animated Yogi Bear 2010 film.[29] Unlike his character on the cartoon show, he is "dumb-but-not-in-a-funny-way", according to the Buffalo News.[30] He was cast in the part after two auditions; as a joke, he sent Warner Bros. an improvised video audition with an actual bear, though he had already been offered the part before they received it.[31] In 2011, he appeared in the film Our Idiot Brother. He had a cameo as administrative personnel for Rolling Stone in the 2012 film Rock of Ages. He starred in the 2016 movie Search Party alongside Adam Pally.[32] In 2014, he appeared in Transformers: Age of Extinction.[33] In November 2014, he was the voice of Fred in the superhero CGI film Big Hero 6. He also played Weasel in Deadpool and Deadpool 2. In 2017, he portrayed the voice of the main protagonist Gene, a meh emoji with abnormal expressions, in the animated The Emoji Movie,[34] which received extremely negative reviews. In late March 2018, he appeared in a supporting role as I-R0K in the film Ready Player One, which was directed by Steven Spielberg. Audio[edit] On September 12, 2011, Miller released a comedy rap concept album titled The Extended Play E.P. The album features comedians Bo Burnham, Doug Benson, Pete Holmes and hip-hop artists Ugly Duckling and Johnny Polygon.[35] In 2012, Miller released The Extended Play E.P. Illegal Art Remix Tape.[36] Also in 2012, Miller released Mash Up Audiofile on Comedy Central Records to mixed reviews.[37] Miller started appearing on Chicago-based comedy Podcast Red Bar Radio in 2006 as a semi-regular co-host. He hosts a podcast with friend and fellow comedian Cash Levy, titled Cashing in With TJ Miller, which began airing in March 2012 on the Nerdist Network.[38] He is also a frequent guest on Doug Benson's podcast Doug Loves Movies.[39] Personal life[edit] In 2014, Miller became engaged to his longtime girlfriend, actress and installation artist Kate Gorney, who changed her last name to Miller.[27] They were married at the Denver Botanic Gardens on September 6, 2015.[40][41] Miller described learning about an undiagnosed cerebral arteriovenous malformation on his right frontal lobe on the Pete Holmes podcast You Made It Weird on October 28, 2011. He stated that he became more philosophical, narrated his behaviors, and was unable to sleep while filming Yogi Bear in New Zealand in 2010. His brain surgery was successful, though there was a 10 percent risk of fatality.[19][42] Miller considers himself a "positive nihilist".[43] Controversies[edit] Uber assault incident[edit] On December 9, 2016, Miller was arrested and jailed in Los Angeles for allegedly assaulting a driver of the Uber car service company following a debate he had with the driver over Donald Trump, of whom Miller is a critic. He was released on his own recognizance after bail was set at $20,000.[44][45] Miller reached a settlement with the driver in March 2018.[46] Sexual assault allegations[edit] In late 2017, allegations against Miller from his time in college in 2001 resurfaced. An anonymous woman who attended George Washington University with Miller told The Daily Beast reporter Asawin Suebsaeng that Miller (her then-boyfriend)[47] became violent with her during a sexual encounter; he allegedly choked, shook, and punched her in the mouth, all without her consent. Suebsaeng attempted to contact witnesses and other people involved with the case, some of whom corroborated the accuser's story, adding that it was brought to the attention of the college at the time. Student conduct proceedings were held, the results of which are sealed, although Suebsaeng wrote that (unnamed) "knowledgeable sources" had said that, despite Miller having already graduated by that time, he was declared to be "expelled" at the conclusion of the proceedings.[48] The Millers responded to the allegations, characterizing the accuser as a vindictive former colleague in a campus comedy troupe who was asked to leave due to inappropriate behavior. The statement said that "[s]adly she is now using the current climate to bandwagon and launch these false accusations again", and also stated that her accusation "undermines the important movement to make women feel safe coming forward about legitimate claims against real known predators".[49] Amtrak bomb threat incident[edit] Miller was arrested on the night of April 9, 2018, at LaGuardia Airport in Queens, New York on federal charges related to a fake bomb threat made while aboard an Amtrak train. The Department of Justice said he placed an emergency call on March 18, 2018, and reported that a female passenger had "a bomb in her bag" while traveling on by train toward Penn Station in New York City. After authorities evacuated and searched the Amtrak Train 2256, it turned out that Miller was actually on Amtrak Train 2258, which was also evacuated of passengers and searched.[50] No evidence of any explosive device or materials was found. Witnesses said Miller appeared to be drunk and involved, "in hostile exchanges with a woman who was sitting in a different row from him in the first-class car", and that he had been removed from the train prior to his intended stop due to his intoxication. On April 10, 2018, he was released on a $100,000 bond following an appearance at a federal court hearing in New Haven, Connecticut.[50][51][52][53] Miller tried to negotiate a plea deal to avoid a trial.[54] As a result of this and the sexual assault allegations, DreamWorks Animation removed Miller from How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, with Justin Rupple overdubbing his lines as Tuffnut through Automated Dialogue Replacement.[55] The preliminary hearing in the case has been adjourned, and has not taken place yet.[56][57] Work misconduct accusations[edit] On July 18, 2018, actress Alice Wetterlund, who played recurring character Carla, a programmer on Silicon Valley, a show in which Miller starred, took to Twitter to accuse Miller of inappropriate, unprofessional behavior on set, writing, "I hope to not ruin it for you, but TJ Miller was a bully and petulant brat."[58] In response to her post, HBO, the network that produces the series, released a statement declaring that, "While this is the first time we have heard Alice Wetterlund comment on her experiences on 'Silicon Valley', we are disappointed to learn of her concerns. HBO and the producers have always taken very seriously our responsibility to create a welcoming and congenial environment for everyone who works on the show."[58] Filmography[edit] Film[edit] Year Title Role Notes 2008 Cloverfield Hudson "Hud" Platt 2009 The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard Cessna Jim Extract Rory 2010 She's Out of My League Stainer How to Train Your Dragon Tuffnut Thorston (voice) Get Him to the Greek Brian Unstoppable Gilleece Yogi Bear Ranger Jones Legend of the Boneknapper Dragon Tuffnut Thorston (voice) Short film Gulliver's Travels Dan Quint Successful Alcoholics Drake Short film, also co-writer 2011 Our Idiot Brother Billy Orwin Charlie on Parole Charlie Short film Gift of the Night Fury Tuffnut Thorston (voice) Short film 2012 Rock of Ages Rolling Stone Receptionist Seeking a Friend for the End of the World Darcy 2014 How to Train Your Dragon 2 Tuffnut Thorston (voice) Transformers: Age of Extinction Lucas Flannery Dawn of the Dragon Racers Tuffnut Thorston (voice) Short film Big Hero 6[59] Fred (voice) Search Party Jason Jason Nash Is Married Tidal 2015 Hell and Back Augie (voice) 2016 Deadpool Weasel Office Christmas Party Clay Vanstone 2017 Goon: Last of the Enforcers Chad Bailey The Emoji Movie[34] Gene (voice) Razzie Award for Worst Screen Combo (as an emoji) (shared with any obnoxious emoji) 2018 Ready Player One i-R0k Deadpool 2 Weasel 2020 Underwater Paul Abel The Stand In Louis Television[edit] Year Title Role Notes 2007–2008 Carpoolers Marmaduke Brooker 13 episodes Traffic Light Jason Episode: "Breaking Bread" Happy Endings Jason Shershow Episode: "The Shershow Redemption" Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas Prancer (voice) Television short Fact Checkers Unit Cop Episode: "Excessive Gass" T.J.
