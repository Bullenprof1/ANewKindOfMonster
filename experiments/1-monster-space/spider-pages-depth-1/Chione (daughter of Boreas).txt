For other uses, see Chione (Greek myth). Chione killed with an arrow supported by her two sons In Greek mythology, Chione (Ancient Greek: Χιονη Khione from χιών chiōn, "snow")[1] was the daughter of Boreas, the god of the north wind, and Orithyia a daughter of Erechtheus, king of Athens. Chione was the sister of Cleopatra (wife of Phineus, king of Thrace) and the Argonauts, Calaïs and Zetes.[2] According to a late, though generally accepted tradition, Chione was the mother of Poseidon's son Eumolpus whom she threw into the ocean for fear of her father's reaction; however, Eumolpus is rescued and raised by Poseidon.[3] See also[edit] Perchta, a pagan Germanic winter goddess Notes[edit] ^ Liddell and Scott, s.v. χιών. ^ Tripp, s.v.
