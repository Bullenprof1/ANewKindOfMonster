The Succubus Artist Auguste Rodin Year 1889 Medium Bronze with dark brown and green patina Location Museo Soumaya, Mexico City The Succubus The Succubus is a bronze sculpture with a green and dark brown patina. It was originally conceived in 1889 by the French artist Auguste Rodin as part of a set of works showing sirens and Nereids. It later formed part of his state-commissioned monument to Victor Hugo.[1] It is now in the Museo Soumaya in Mexico City. It shows a succubus, a demon taking on female form to deceive and seduce human men. The figure kneels in a feline posture, evoking medieval associations between cats and the forces of darkness.[1] She is beautiful and her eyes are closed, but her mouth is open and screaming.[1] References[edit] ^ a b c The Age of Rodin (1st edition).
