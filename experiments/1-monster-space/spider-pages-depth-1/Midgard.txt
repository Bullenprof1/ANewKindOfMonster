The Old Norse form plays a notable role in Norse cosmology.

In Old Saxon Heliand it appears as Middilgard and in Old High German poem Muspilli it appears as Mittilagart. The Gothic form Midjungards is attested in the Gospel of Luke as a translation of the Greek word Œø·º∞Œ∫ŒøœÖŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑. The word is present in Old English epic and poetry as Middangeard; later transformed to Middell√¶rd or Mittelerde ("Middle-earth") in Middle English literature.[1] All these forms are from a Common Germanic *midja-gardaz (*meddila-, *medjan-), a compound of *midja- "middle" and *gardaz "yard, enclosure". In early Germanic cosmology, the term stands alongside world (Old English weorold, Old Saxon werold, Old High German weralt, Old Frisian warld and Old Norse ver«´ld), from a Common Germanic compound *wira-alƒëiz, the "age of men".[2] Old Norse[edit] In Norse mythology, Mi√∞gar√∞r became applied to the wall around the world that the gods constructed from the eyebrows of the giant Ymir as a defense against the Jotuns who lived in Jotunheim, east of Manheimr, the "home of men", a word used to refer to the entire world. The gods slew the giant Ymir, the first created being, and put his body into the central void of the universe, creating the world out of his body: his flesh constituting the land, his blood the oceans, his bones the mountains, his teeth the cliffs, his hairs the trees, and his brains the clouds. Ymir's skull was held by four dwarfs, Nordri, Sudri, Austri, and Vestri, who represent the four points on the compass and became the dome of heaven. The sun, moon, and stars were said to be scattered sparks in the skull. The Fyrby Runestone. According to the Eddas, Midgard will be destroyed at Ragnar√∂k, the battle at the end of the world. J√∂rmungandr will arise from the ocean, poisoning the land and sea with his venom and causing the sea to rear up and lash against the land. The final battle will take place on the plane of V√≠gr√≠√∞r, following which Midgard and almost all life on it will be destroyed, with the earth sinking into the sea only to rise again, fertile and green when the cycle repeats and the creation begins again. Although most surviving instances of the word Midgard refer to spiritual matters, it was also used in more mundane situations, as in the Viking Age runestone poem from the inscription S√∂ 56 from Fyrby: Iak v√¶it Hast√¶in √æa Holmst√¶in br√∏√∞r, m√¶nnr rynasta a Mi√∞gar√∞i, sattu st√¶in auk stafa marga √¶ftiR Fr√∏yst√¶in, fa√∞ur sinn.[3] I know H√°steinn Holmsteinns brother, the most rune-skilled men in Middle Earth, placed a stone and many letters in memory of Freysteinn, their father. The Danish and Swedish form Midg√•rd or Midgaard, the Norwegian Midgard or Midg√•rd, as well as the Icelandic and Faroese form Mi√∞gar√∞ur, all derive from the Old Norse term. Old and Middle English[edit] The name middangeard occurs six times in the Old English epic poem Beowulf, and is the same word as Midgard in Old Norse. The term is equivalent in meaning to the Greek term Oikoumene, as referring to the known and inhabited world. The concept of Midgard occurs many times in Middle English. The association with earth (OE eor√∞e) in Middle English middell√¶rd, middelerde is by popular etymology; the continuation of geard "enclosure" is yard. An early example of this transformation is from the Ormulum: √æatt ure Drihhtin wollde / ben borenn i √æiss middell√¶rd that our Lord wanted / be born in this Middle-earth. The usage of "Middle-earth" as a name for a setting was popularized by Old English scholar J. R. R. Tolkien in his The Lord of the Rings and other fantasy works; he was originally inspired by the references to middangeard and √âarendel in the Old English poem Crist¬†A. Old High German[edit] Mittilagart is mentioned in the 9th-century Old High German Muspilli (v. 54) meaning "the world" as opposed to the sea and the heavens: muor varsuuilhit sih, suilizot lougiu der himil, mano uallit, prinnit mittilagart Sea is swallowed, flaming burn the heavens, Moon falls, Midgard burns References[edit] ^ "Midgard", Online Etymology Dictionary. ^ Orel, Vladimir E.
