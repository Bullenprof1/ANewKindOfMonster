In Greek mythology, Idyia (Ancient Greek: Ἰδυῖα) or Eidyia (Ancient Greek: Εἰδυῖα; /aɪˈdaɪ.ə/) was a daughter of Oceanus and Tethys,[1] and queen to Aeëtes, king of Colchis.[2] She was the mother of Medea, Chalciope and Absyrtus.[3][4][5][6] According to Apollonius of Rhodes, she was the youngest of the Oceanides.[7] Her name means "the knowing one" derived from the Greek word εἴδω (eídō) meaning "to see" or "to know".
