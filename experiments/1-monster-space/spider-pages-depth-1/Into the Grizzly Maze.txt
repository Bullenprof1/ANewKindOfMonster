Years later, the brothers have become estranged; Beckett has become a local deputy while Rowan is an ex-convict. Coming home to Alaska, Rowan meets up with old friend Mary Cadillac, who gives him supplies and asks him to find her husband Johnny. Meanwhile, at a cabin in the deep woods, three hunters are chopping off bear paws. One hunter, Johnny, declares they leave the cabin the next day. The others, Mike and Dolly, insist they are not, saying they were given an extra week to hunt. Johnny exits the cabin and is shot. Making a run for the treeline, he manages to kill Mike while Dolly is slaughtered by the same large bear the brothers encountered years earlier. At a bar, Rowan meets a girl named Amber, both of whom later go to a motel room together. However, Rowan kicks Amber out upon discovering that Amber is a prostitute. After leaving the room, Amber is assaulted by her boyfriend/pimp, Franco. When Rowan goes out to break it up, he gets into a fight with Franco. A police car arrives and Rowan sees his older brother Beckett for the first time upon his release from prison. After arresting Rowan, Beckett and Sheriff Sully speak with Franco and he is released. Having not seen or spoken to each other in seven years, the brothers have a rocky start. Beckett asks Rowan why he has come home and they visit the family house. Beckett reveals he has married a deaf-mute wildlife photographer and conservationist named Michelle. Rowan reveals he returned to go to the Grizzly Maze and pay respects to their father. Meanwhile, out in the woods during a snowstorm, two loggers and their dog are killed by the bear. The next day Michelle is taking photos of other animals unaware she is being stalked by the bear. After the brothers visit their mother's grave, Beckett gets a radio call about the killed loggers. After dropping Rowan off, Beckett is still suspicious of Rowan's return. Rowan uses a map to find something and comes across a car buried in leaves belonging to Johnny Cadillac. While Beckett investigates the logging incident, hunter and butcher Douglas arrives and tells them that the bear that killed the loggers is far from an ordinary bear, describing it as an intelligent specimen. While Douglas offers his help to track it, Beckett, accompanied by Rowanâ€™s ex-girlfriend Kaley, goes out to the Maze to find Rowan and Michelle. While Sully manages to shut the logging down, out in the woods, Michelle comes face to face with the bear itself, but in doing so, gets caught in a trap she set. Rowan arrives, scares off the bear, and helps Michelle. Sully visits Douglas, who once again informs him that this bear is exacting its wrath due to the poaching and logging rather than satisfying its hunger or establishing its territory. When Zoe, one of Sully's deputies, finds the abandoned car, she is killed by the bear. After Douglas agrees to hunt and kill the bear, Sully and Jerry investigate the car. Beckett and Kaley meet up with Michelle and Rowan. The two brothers then clash until Rowan reveals he came to find Johnny. Later, Michelle and Beckett look at a satellite of their tagged bears and hypothesize they are running away because of the larger bear. Rowan and Kaley catch-up, later that night, Kaley is attacked by the bear. Rowan and Beckett try to shoot it, but the bear runs off. The group packs up to leave the forest. As the bear continues to follow the group, Michelle falls into a dead moose carcass, only to find it is a kill zone full of dead moose. The group decides to make it through the Maze. Sully goes to get the group out by boat. The group encounters Douglas standing over one of Beckett and Michelle's collared bears. Initially believing he killed it, a video recording shows the collared bear was attacked by the larger bear. Going separate ways from Douglas, the group encounter the bear again, however, Kaley is injured. After the group spots the butcher cabin, they decide to leave, especially after finding Johnny dead. Douglas arrives and informs them of something shady having to do with Sully. Setting up camp, Rowan explains to Kaley, during one night in the Maze, Rowan went to Johnny to sell drugs for money. Being a guide to Johnny and his drug dealer, Rowan took the two into the Maze. During a deal, Rowan and the two are hit by state troopers. However, Rowan noticed a ranger was injured and was about to get killed by someone else, but Rowan shot that guy instead and saved the ranger. As Sully comes in on his boat, Douglas shoots the bear and Rowan and Beckett do not find him. Rowan stays behind to distract the bear while Beckett gets the girls to the boat. Rowan manages to make the bear chase him. While chasing Beckett and the girls, Michelle gets separated from them. The bear corners her, but she is saved by Beckett and Douglas. Douglas is killed by the bear. The trio make it to the boat and are encountered by Sully, who reveals he has been taking money and let poachers loose into the Maze. The bear arrives and kills Sully. After Rowan is revealed to be alive, the two brothers fight the bear. Beckett pours gasoline around the bear and then sets the circle on fire, hoping to trap it. However, the bear runs through the flames and brings down the boat. Rowan saves Kaley and stabs the bear in the throat, killing it. With the bear dead, the group then recover and leave the Maze.
