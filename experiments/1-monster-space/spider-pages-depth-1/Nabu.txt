Contents 1 Etymology and meaning 2 History 2.1 Outside Mesopotamia 3 References 4 External links Etymology and meaning[edit] The Akkadian "nabû" means "to announce, prophesize", derived from the Semitic root N-B.[4] It is cognate with the Syriac ܢܒܝܐ(nvīyā), Arabic نبي (nabiyy), and the Hebrew נביא (naví), all meaning "prophet".[citation needed] History[edit] Nabu was worshiped by the Babylonians and the Assyrians.[5] Nabu gained prominence among the Babylonians in the 1st millennium BC when he was identified as the son of the god Marduk.[5] Nabu was worshipped in Babylon's sister city Borsippa, from where his statue was taken to Babylon each New Year so that he could pay his respects to his father.[5] Nabu's symbols included a stylus resting on a tablet as well as a simple wedge shape; King Nabonidus, whose name references Nabu, had a royal sceptre topped with Nabu's wedge.[5][6]:33–34 Clay tablets with especial calligraphic skill were used as offerings at Nabu's temple. His wife was the Akkadian goddess Tashmet.[5] Nabu was the patron god of scribes, literacy, and wisdom.[5] He was also the inventor of writing, a divine scribe, the patron god of the rational arts, and a god of vegetation.[6]:33–34[7] As the god of writing, Nabu inscribed the fates assigned to men and he was associated with the scribe god Ninurta.[7][8] As an oracle he was associated with the Mesopotamian moon god Sin.[6]:33–34 Nabu wore a horned cap, and stood with his hands clasped in the ancient gesture of priesthood. He rode on a winged dragon known as Sirrush that originally belonged to his father Marduk. In Babylonian astrology, Nabu was identified with the planet Mercury.[9][10] Nabu was continuously worshipped until the 2nd century, when cuneiform became a lost art.[5] Outside Mesopotamia[edit] Nabu's cult spread to ancient Egypt.[11] Nabu was one of five non-Egyptian deities worshipped in Elephantine.[citation needed] In the Bible, Nabu is mentioned as Nebo in Isaiah 46:1 and Jeremiah 48:1.[5][12][13] In Hellenistic times, Nabu was sometimes identified with the Greek Apollo as a giver of prophesies.[5][6]:71 As the god of wisdom and a divine messenger associated with the planet Mercury, Nabu was linked with the Greek Hermes, the Roman Mercury, and the Egyptian Thoth.[6]:71 References[edit] ^ Lanfranchi, Giovanni B.
