Based on an idea by Jojiro Okami, the film is a story of mankind's efforts to move Earth out of its orbit to prevent it from colliding with a runaway white dwarf star. The film was extensively edited for its American release.[3] Contents 1 Plot 2 Cast 3 Release 4 Reception 5 See also 6 References 6.1 Footnotes 6.2 Sources 7 External links Plot[edit] Early in 1979, the Interstellar Exploration Agency launches Japanese rocket ship, the JX-1 Hawk, into space on a nine month journey to investigate Saturn. At its conclusion however, the crew is given a new mission after scientists discover a runaway "planet", which the International Astronomical Union nicknamed "Gorath", is somehow running amok. Upon encountering and while investigating Gorath's rapid movement through the Solar System, the JX-1 Hawk crew discover it is smaller than Earth, yet has 6,000 times its gravity. They manage to transmit their data back to Earth before an enormous gravity well destroys the ship, killing the crew. A month later in 1980, astronomers and astrophysicists throughout the international community announce that Gorath will collide with the Earth in two years time. At the United Nations, a gathering of Earth's top scientists attempt to resolve the situation by pooling together large amounts of technical advancements they made in the past two decades. After a debriefing, the scientific community reveals the South Pole Operation, which involves a base in Antarctica designed to house a large international team of engineers and scientists and the construction of huge "mega-thrusters" which will propel the Earth out of Gorath's path within 100 days and move Earth back once the danger has passed. The U.N. approves and sends the prototype sub-light spacecraft JX-2 Eagle into space to obtain further data on Gorath. Construction on the South Pole Operation base goes underway as ships and helicopters from several nations bring in building material and powerful, mobile heat-generating devices known as atomic burrowers are quickly cobbled together to assist in creating the caverns required to house the mega-thrusters. Meanwhile, the JX-2 Eagle crew succeeds in its mission, learning that Gorath is absorbing space debris within its gravity well to continuously add to its mass, and transmit the data to U.N. space stations. On Earth, the mega-thrusters are activated for a test run while citizens from around the world watch on a live broadcast. As the Earth gently moves, the South Pole Operation is hailed as a success. The JX-2 Eagle and space stations learn of this development and are ordered to return to deny Gorath more mass. However, the heat generated by the mega-thrusters causes a giant, walrus-like monster later dubbed "Maguma" to emerge from the tundra and attack the South Pole Operation base in response to their intrusion. In response, a small VTOL aircraft is equipped with a powerful laser to stop Maguma. Determined to do so without killing the monster, the pilot uses the laser to create an avalanche and bury it. However, Maguma easily escapes and resumes its attack, leaving the crew with little choice but to kill it. As Gorath absorbs Saturn's rings, the JX-2 Eagle crew successfully return to Earth. As the enormous celestial body becomes visible to the naked eye, Earth's tides begin to rise and a state of emergency is declared. Gorath absorbs and obliterates the Moon. It also floods Tokyo and the mega-thrusters and causes an earthquake that destroys the JX-2 Eagle and the Interstellar Exploration Agency's Mount Fuji facility. Even in spite of these disasters, Earth is successfully moved out of Gorath's path before returning to its original orbit.
