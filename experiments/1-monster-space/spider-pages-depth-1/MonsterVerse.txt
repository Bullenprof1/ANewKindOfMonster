Borenstein credits Legendary Entertainment's founder and then CEO Thomas Tull as the one responsible for the MonsterVerse, having acquired the rights to Godzilla and negotiate the complicated rights to King Kong. Tull had offered Borenstein the opportunity to write the first draft for Kong: Skull Island, with the goal to establish Kong in the same universe as Legendary's Godzilla film. Tull's vision was for the films to one day lead to Godzilla vs. Kong.[4] Legendary confirmed at the July 2014 San Diego Comic-Con International that it had acquired the licensing rights to Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah from Toho and revealed concept footage with the closing title cards reading "Conflict: inevitable. Let them fight".[5] In September 2015, Legendary announced that the film Kong: Skull Island would not be developed with Universal Studios. Instead, it would be developed with Warner Bros., which sparked media speculation that Godzilla and Kong would appear in a film together.[6][7] In October 2015, Legendary announced plans to unite Godzilla and Kong in a film titled Godzilla vs. Kong, set for a 2020 release date. Legendary plans to create a shared cinematic franchise "centered around Monarch" (the secret government agency which debuted in 2014's Godzilla) and that "brings together Godzilla and Legendary’s King Kong in an ecosystem of other giant super-species, both classic and new".[8] Later in October, it was announced that Kong: Skull Island would have references to Monarch.[9] In May 2016, Warner Bros. announced that Godzilla vs. Kong would be released on May 29, 2020, later pushed back to May 21, 2021, and that Godzilla: King of the Monsters would be pushed back from its original June 8, 2018 release date to March 22, 2019,[10] however, the film was later pushed back again to May 31, 2019. In October 2016, Legendary announced that Godzilla: King of the Monsters would be filmed at its parent company Wanda's Oriental Movie Metropolis facility in Qingdao, China, along with Pacific Rim: Uprising.[11] That same month, it was revealed that Legendary was planning a writers room to create their Godzilla–Kong cinematic universe, with Alex Garcia overseeing the project for Legendary.[12] In early January 2017, Thomas Tull, founder of Legendary, resigned from the company but would remain as producer for the Godzilla–Kong series, which was revealed as the MonsterVerse.[13] In March 2017, Legendary assembled a writers room led by Terry Rossio to develop the story for Godzilla vs. Kong.[14] Films[edit] Film Release date Director Story by Screenwriter(s) Producers Godzilla May 16, 2014 (2014-05-16) Gareth Edwards David Callaham Max Borenstein Thomas Tull, Jon Jashni, Mary Parent and Brian Rogers Kong: Skull Island March 10, 2017 (2017-03-10) Jordan Vogt-Roberts John Gatins Dan Gilroy and Max Borenstein and Derek Connolly Thomas Tull, Jon Jashni, Mary Parent and Alex Garcia Godzilla: King of the Monsters May 31, 2019 Michael Dougherty Max Borenstein, Michael Dougherty, and Zach Shields Michael Dougherty & Zach Shields Thomas Tull, Jon Jashni, Mary Parent, Alex Garcia and Brian Rogers Godzilla vs. Kong March 24, 2021 Adam Wingard Terry Rossio, Michael Dougherty, and Zach Shields Eric Pearson and Max Borenstein Thomas Tull, Jon Jashni, Brian Rogers, Mary Parent, Alex Garcia, and Eric McLeod Godzilla[edit] Main article: Godzilla (2014 film) The film reimagines Godzilla's origins in contemporary times and is set 15 years after a nuclear meltdown in Japan which was caused by giant parasitic creatures, known as "MUTOs". As two MUTOs ravage the countryside in order to reproduce, they awaken a larger ancient alpha predator, known as "Godzilla", whose existence has been kept secret by the U.S. government since 1954. The film introduces Godzilla, the MUTOs, and the Monarch organization to the MonsterVerse. In 2004, director Yoshimitsu Banno acquired permission from Toho to produce a short IMAX Godzilla film which was in development for several years until the project was eventually turned over to Legendary Pictures.[15][16] In March 2010, Legendary announced to have acquired the rights to Godzilla for a feature film reboot.[17] In January 2011, Gareth Edwards was announced as the director for the film.[18] The film was co-produced with Warner Bros.

Kong: Skull Island was released on March 10, 2017 to positive reviews,[30][31] and was a box office success, grossing $566 million worldwide against a budget of $185 million.[32] The film received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 90th Academy Awards.[33] Godzilla: King of the Monsters[edit] Main article: Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019 film) In the film, humanity must rely on Godzilla and Mothra to defeat King Ghidorah and Rodan, the former having awakened other Titans to destroy the world. The film changes the monsters' designation from "MUTOs" to "Titans".[34] The film introduces Scylla, Methuselah, Behemoth, and the Queen MUTO to the MonsterVerse.[35][36] Off-screen, the film introduces Baphomet, Typhon, Mokele-Mbembe, Sargon, Tiamat, Abaddon, Leviathan, and Bunyip to the MonsterVerse.[35][37] Prior to announcing a shared cinematic universe between Godzilla and Kong, Legendary originally intended to produce a Godzilla trilogy, with Gareth Edwards attached to direct all films.[38] However, Edwards left the sequel in May 2016 to work on smaller scale projects.[39] In January 2017, Michael Dougherty was announced as the director and co-writer for the film.[40] Principal photography began in June 2017, in Atlanta, Georgia and wrapped in September 2017.[41] The film was released on May 31, 2019.

The film introduces Mechagodzilla,[49] Warbat,[50] and Hellhawk[51] to the MonsterVerse. The project was announced in October 2015 when Legendary announced plans for a shared cinematic universe between Godzilla and King Kong.

DeKnight (director and co-writer of Pacific Rim: Uprising) noted that there have been discussion about a cross-over between the MonsterVerse and Pacific Rim franchise, however, he iterated it was all theoretical possibilities.[90] Guillermo Del Toro (director and co-writer of Pacific Rim) had also expressed interest of Pacific Rim crossing over with the Monsterverse.[91] In March 2019, when asked about the future of the MonsterVerse, producer Alex Garcia stated: "It's one brick at a time, each piece has to be as good as it can be, so right now it's all focused on this [Godzilla: King of the Monsters and Godzilla vs. Kong]. But could there be? Yeah, that's the hope if the movies turn out really well."[92] In February 2021, Adam Wingard (director of Godzilla vs. Kong) stated, "I know where we could go potentially with future films", however, he noted that the MonsterVerse was created "to a certain degree" to lead towards Godzilla vs. Kong.[93] Wingard added that the MonsterVerse is at a "crossroads", stating, "It’s really at the point where audiences have to kind of step forward and vote for more of these things. If this movie is a success obviously they will continue forward."[94] In April 2021, Legendary's CEO Josh Grode commented on potential sequels, "we have a number of ideas for more movies."[95] That same month, the hashtag #ContinueTheMonsterverse began trending on Twitter, which garnered support from Jordan Vogt-Roberts (director of Kong: Skull Island) and was acknowledged by Legendary.[96][97] See also[edit] Godzilla (franchise) King Kong (franchise) Pacific Rim (film) Kaiju Notes[edit] ^ Middleditch had an unrelated, voice-over cameo as "Jerry" in Kong: Skull Island. ^ Entertainment Weekly, Box Office Mojo, and Deadline Hollywood reported that the film's production budget was $170 million; however, Deadline also noted that other analysts marked the budget at $185 million.[58][59][60] In July 2018, the Hindustan Times reported the budget to be $200 million.[61] This figure was later confirmed in an analysis by Variety published in June 2019.[62] ^ The Numbers reported the production budget to be $155 million.[64] In December 2020, Variety reported the budget to be $160 million,[65] while TheWrap reported the budget to be $165 million.[66] In January 2021, both The Hollywood Reporter and Deadline Hollywood stated the budget to be $200 million.[67][68] In February 2021, Comingsoon.net also noted the film's budget to be $200 million.[69] References[edit] Citations[edit] ^ "MonsterVerse Trademark Application of Legendary Pictures, LLC".
