Mintz's Krazy Kat/Screen Gems studio, where he started as an inker in 1929. He remained at Mintz for ten years.[3] Walt Disney Studio[edit] In 1940, he moved to the Walt Disney Studio, where he animated on Fantasia and Dumbo, as well as several Pluto shorts (Bone Trouble and Pluto's Playmate). By 1942, he mostly worked on Donald Duck shorts such as Donald Gets Drafted. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer[edit] Patterson left Disney in 1943 to work at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio, his first short for them being War Dogs. While he mostly worked in the studio's Hanna-Barbera unit, he occasionally provided animation for Tex Avery's unit (as well as Avery's substitute director Dick Lundy). He worked on several Academy Award-winning animation shorts: Mouse Trouble (1944), Quiet Please! (1945), The Little Orphan (1948), and Johann Mouse (1952). Grantray-Lawrence Animation[edit] Patterson left MGM in 1954 to co-found (with former MGM colleague Grant Simmons) Grantray-Lawrence Animation, which he operated until 1967. GrantRay-Lawrence's early work was providing animation for television commercials, including the original "Winston Tastes Good" campaign. The company later moved on to producing such animated television series as Spider-Man and The Marvel Superheroes.[3] Hanna-Barbera[edit] After GrantRay-Lawrence folded in 1967, Patterson joined his former bosses at Hanna-Barbera, where he worked as a supervising director on several animated television series. Patterson was eventually promoted to Vice President in charge of animation direction, a position he held until his retirement in 1993. Awards and honors[edit] Patterson was awarded the 1999 Winsor McCay Award by the International Animated Film Society, ASIFA-Hollywood for his lifetime of contributions to the animation field.[2] Personal life[edit] Ray was married to June Walker Patterson. June worked at Disney as a cel painter.[4] They had four daughters.[2] Death[edit] Patterson died of natural causes, in Encino, California on December 30, 2001, a month after his 90th birthday.[3][2] Filmography[edit] Year Title Credits Characters 1940 Fantasia Animator - Segment "Dance of the Hours" 1941 Dumbo Animator 1973 Charlotte's Web Animator 1978 Scooby's All Stars Laff a Lympics Season 2 1990 Jetsons the Movie Animation Director 1993 Once Upon a Forest Timing Director References in popular culture[edit] This article appears to contain trivial, minor, or unrelated references to popular culture.
