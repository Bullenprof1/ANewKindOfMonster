The pages in this category are redirects from moved (renamed) titles. To add a redirect to this category, place {{Rcat shell|{{R from move}}}} on the second new line (skip a line) after #REDIRECT [[Target page name]]. For more information follow the links. Never substitute redirect template(s), nor place them on soft redirects. See also the complete list of redirect templates and the redirect style guide. This is a maintenance category, used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project. It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages, or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories. This is a tracking category. It builds and maintains a list of pages primarily for the sake of the list itself. They are not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme. This category is hidden on its member pages—unless the corresponding user preference (appearance → show hidden categories) is set. These categories are used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse" (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list (discriminated by classifications). This template should only be transcluded in the category namespace(s). These redirects are used to avoid breaking links, internal and external, that may have been made to the old page titles. The rcat used to tag redirects and populate this category, {{R from move}}, is automatically added to a redirect that results from a page move/rename. Older redirects from page moves may still need to be tagged manually.
