Her father and sister Yaroslava think she is immature because she still likes fairy tales and playing with toys. According to an ancient custom, Mira is placed on a boat deck in her wedding finery to be sent across the water to her future husband, Igor. As Igor pulls her boat toward him, his people sing an ancient wedding song. In the middle of the wedding, a dragon captures Mira. She is held prisoner in a cave where Mira meets a strange young man who cannot remember his name. Mira believes he is another prisoner and calls him Arman (Matvey Lykov). Soon, she discovers that Arman is the dragon who abducted her. He lives in human form, holding back the inner beast, but sometimes turns into a dragon against his will. As a dragon, Arman is unable to control himself. Arman shows Mira the island and a place for her to create a home. He tells her that male dragons had long lived on the island. As a dragon boy he had been allowed to choose whether to stay human or become a dragon. He chose to remain human until a dragon slayer killed his father. In his grief and rage, he became a dragon, gaining the knowledge of all dragons who had come before him. Realizing that dragons were truly monsters, Arman isolated himself on the island to prevent himself from killing humans. Sensing the uncontrollable transition to dragon form, he would go into the cave where the dragon could not escape and remain there until reverting to human form. He abducted Mira because of a ritual song sung at her wedding by villagers believing dragons to be extinct. The song caught Arman off guard and he did not have time to hide in the cave before responding to the song's summons. Arman wants to live as a man and crush his inner dragon because he is afraid of harming Mira. Mira talks with Arman and teaches him to live as a human. As they get to know one another, Arman and Mira fall in love although Mira is still afraid of the dragon. The island is bewitched so that only those who are loved by someone on the island can find the way to it. Because Mira's feelings toward Igor change as she falls in love with Arman, Igor searches futilely in a fog. Mira's fear of the dragon causes her to secretly prepare a boat in order to escape. Learning of her preparations, Arman despairs of ever being able to control the dragon and reveals to Mira what happened to the other dragon brides. Dragons brought the sacrificed girls to the island and burned them to death. From the ashes of each girl a new dragon boy was born. Arman orders Mira to leave so that she will avoid this fate. Without Mira, Arman does not know how to continue living. Mira returns home. While preparing again for her wedding with Igor, Mira realizes that she loves Arman and cannot live without him. While on the boat, Mira sings the ritual song to call the dragon. Arman hears the song as he is ending his life and changes into the dragon. He recaptures Mira and brings her to the island, intending to burn her. Mira does not show fear to the dragon and confesses her love for him. This allows Arman to finally control himself as a dragon. Years later, Mira and Arman are living together on the island with their daughter. Mira flies on her dragon-husband, who is no longer dangerous to her, and they live happily ever after.[9] Cast[edit] Maria Poezzhaeva[2] as Princess Miroslava "Mira" Matvey Lykov[2] as Arman / Dragon Ivo Gospodinov as Arman boy Stanislav Lyubshin[2] as Prince, Miroslava's father Ieva Andrejevaite[2] as Princess Yaroslava, Miroslava's older sister Pyotr Romanov[2] as Igor, grandson of the Dragon Slayer, Miroslava's groom Andrey Lebedinskiy as a helmsman Yola Sanko as old woman-priestess Viktoriya Runtsova[2] as bride, a victim to the Dragon Anastasiya Dubrovina as bride, a victim to the Dragon Alyona Chekhova[2] as bride, a victim to the Dragon Darya Dubnikova as bride, a victim to the Dragon Yuriy Gorin as father of the bride Lyubov Firsova as mother of the bride Aleksandr Luchinin as Igor's grandfather Egor Zubarchuk as Arman's father Viktor Korolyov as episode Marta Timofeeva as daughter of Mira and Arman Production[edit] Development[edit] He's a Dragon was the feature film directorial debut of Indar Dzhendubaev. To the post of director he was invited by Timur Bekmambetov, who acted as the main producer of the film. Filming took place in the Black Sea.[10][11] According to the creators of the film, they have preserved much of the literary original, but at the same time brought new elements to the story.[12] The film, 85% of which consisted of computer graphics, was drawn with the help of Russian computers. The posters for the film were created at a 16-hour photo shoot by the photographer Uldus Bakhtiozina.[13] During shooting, only film cameras were used, and the resulting pictures were not subjected to any additional processing, which is an absolute rarity for posters of modern films. Filming[edit] Principal photography took place at the beginning that August 2014 in Bulgaria is the main scenes were shot on the Black Sea coast and in the picturesque Prohodna cave. Then the crew will go to the Black Sea coast, in the town of Sinemorets. The Bulgarian stage of filming will end on September 26, 2014, in December 2014 the remaining scenes will be shot in Moscow, Russia. In the Moscow Pavilions, the initial scenes were completed: the abduction of the main character, flying a dragon, scenes in his den and the finale. Music[edit] The score was composed by Simon Finley. Russian folk-rock band Melnitsa (ru) recorded a song for the film titled "Rite" (whose title and lyrics reference the novel "The Ritual", on which the film is based). It was, however, not included in the final film. Singer-songwriter Jenia Lubich contributed to the soundtrack with her song Колыбельная тишины (Lullaby of Silence), which plays over the end credits. A music video was released on December 7th, 2015, and has over 5 million views on YouTube. The song later appeared on her 2016 studio album Снежно (Snowy). Post-production[edit] The film’s special effects were worked by professionals from the CGF (ru) computer graphics studio, directed by Aleksandr Gorokhov, who had previously been involved in the production of such films. Release[edit] On November 24, 2015 in Moscow hosted the magnificent premiere on the stage of the Moscow cinema "October". The film was released in the Russian Federation by Bazelevs Film Company on December 3, 2015 and the world premiere of December 4, 2015. The film was released in the United States by 4Digital Media on 6 June 2017. Marketing[edit] The first trailer was released in the United States in April 2017.[14] Reception[edit] Box office[edit] The film flopped at the Russian box office, collecting only $1.7 million (114 million rubles), and in view of rentals in other CIS countries – $1.8 million, which is significantly less than the film's budget of $18 million. It, however, had great success at the Chinese box office, grossing CN¥60.1 million, making it the most successful film in China in the history of Russian cinema.[1][15][16][17][18][19][20] It was the overall highest-grossing Russian film at the international box office in 2016.[6][7][8] Critical response[edit] The film was met with mixed reviews. Such publications as Film.ru,[21] The Hollywood Reporter,[22] Izvestia[23] and Afisha,[24] responded positively to the film. Boris Ivanov, film critic of Film.ru, stated: "From whatever angle you look at it, the Hollywood movie "Twilight" seems like an amateur performance in comparison to "I am Dragon". Even the computer effects in the Russian production are more convincing. From the point of view of the genre, this is an almost impeccable "feminine" romantic fantasy."[22] Dmitry Ostashevsky, Russian film critic of The Hollywood Reporter, stated: "The computer animation and 3D graphics are so good that you begin to regret that such a cool dragon (that is, by the way, recognised as the most technologically complex virtual character in the whole history of Russian cinema) was chosen for the genre of melodrama and not blockbuster."[22] Others, in particular Mir Fantastiki,[25] Weburg,[26] and Kino-Teatr,[27] rated it as average. "Rossiyskaya Gazeta" defeated the film, calling it "unimaginably boring", and the script "delusional".[28] References[edit] ^ a b c d "他是龙（2016）". cbooo.cn (in Chinese).
