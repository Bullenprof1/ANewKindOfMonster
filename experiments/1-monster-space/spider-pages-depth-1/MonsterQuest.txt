Instead, it takes a seemingly well-researched approach, leaving viewers the opportunity to make up their own minds." He also believed that the "content is certainly nerd-worthy in an I-want-to-believe/Mulder kind of way".[1] Cinematic Happenings Under Development (CHUD) gave the show a 5.9/10 review, saying that the show is "basically a rehashing of the 1970s/1980s TV show, In Search Of..." and "it leaves you with a sense of either 'been there, done that' or just a feeling of incompleteness because it basically raises as many questions as it tries to answer."[2] Diablo Cody gave the show high praise in the October 24, 2008 issue of the magazine Entertainment Weekly. She says, "I found a minotaur in that labyrinth of suck: MonsterQuest...on the History Channel."[3] Cancellation[edit] In a statement made March 24, 2010 on the cryptozoological blog CryptoMundo, MonsterQuest producer Doug Hajicek announced that History Channel had canceled the series midway through 4th season. Hajicek said, "The official end of MonsterQuest did not happen because of any lack of topics or for lack of viewers. The Network has decided to go another direction to assure their future as a powerful force in television."[4] Episodes[edit] Season No. episodes Year(s) aired 1 14 2007–2008 2 20 2008 3 25 2009 4 9 2010 SP N/A 2020 Season one (2007–2008)[edit] Episode Title Original Airdate 101 (1) "America's Loch Ness Monster" October 31, 2007 (2007-10-31) An investigation of the plesiosaur-like lake monster nicknamed Champ that supposedly lurks in Lake Champlain, dubbed "America's Loch Ness Monster." 102 (2) "Sasquatch Attack" November 7, 2007 (2007-11-07) A look into bizarre attacks upon a remote hunting cabin in Northern Ontario by suspected Bigfoot creatures and other reports of aggressive Sasquatch in the North Western United States. 103 (3) "Giant Squid Found" November 14, 2007 (2007-11-14) A search off Mexico's Sea of Cortez for the capture and study of abnormally large Humboldt squids. 104 (4) "Birdzilla" November 21, 2007 (2007-11-21) A look at the legendary Thunderbird and a review of sightings of other giant birds in Illinois, Texas, and Alaska. 105 (5) "Bigfoot" November 28, 2007 (2007-11-28) The continued investigations of Bigfoot in Washington State and a digital enhancement study of the infamous 1967 Patterson–Gimlin film to find out if the film actually depicts a Bigfoot. 106 (6) "Mutant Canines" December 5, 2007 (2007-12-05) An investigation into reports of attacks on pets and livestock in Maine and Minnesota by strange hybrid canines. 107 (7) "Lions in the Backyard" December 12, 2007 (2007-12-12) A hunt for large black cats and jaguar-like creatures that eyewitnesses say are encroaching into human populated areas of Arizona, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York. 108 (8) "Gigantic Killer Fish" December 19, 2007 (2007-12-19) The search for massive freshwater fish reported from the Arctic to the Amazon river. 109 (9) "Swamp Beast" December 26, 2007 (2007-12-26) A trek deep into the swamps of Louisiana and Florida in search of the legendary Skunk Ape. 110 (10) "Russia's Killer Apemen" January 2, 2008 (2008-01-02) The search to validate a bizarre story that former Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin had a plan to create ape-human hybrids. 111 (11) "Unidentified Flying Creatures" January 9, 2008 (2008-01-09) An investigation into the purported existence of extra-dimensional atmospheric creatures known as Rods. 112 (12) "The Real Hobbit" January 16, 2008 (2008-01-16) A look into Southeast Asian reports of "Hobbit-like" humanoids called Homo floresiensis and the humanoid-ape creature known as the Orang Pendek. 113 (13) "Giganto: The Real King Kong" January 19, 2008 (2008-01-19) An investigation into reports of the continued existence of Gigantopithecus, a huge species of extinct ape that inspired the tales of King Kong. 114 (14) "American Werewolf" January 23, 2008 (2008-01-23) A review of Wisconsin and Michigan sighting reports of a supposed werewolf-like creature also known as the "Beast of Bray Road" and the "Michigan Dogman."
