Meanwhile, five friends; Billy, his girlfriend Cruz, Lita, her boyfriend Gus and Julian are on their way to Fairlake to celebrate the Mountain Man Music Festival for Halloween. Along the way, they almost run over Maynard who attacks them. Billy, Gus and Julian attack him out of self-defense, but are all apprehended along with Lita and Cruz by town sheriff Angela Carter and her deputy partner Kevin Biggs. While Carter leaves to take them to the police station, the cannibals appear and kill Biggs. Locked up in the police station, Billy convinces Carter to release his friends as he owns his drugs and they left as he remained in his cell. Meanwhile, the cannibals use their truck to pull down a phone pole, taking out service to the town. They then proceed to the power plant, where they kill a guard and shut down the town's electricity. While most of the townspeople have attended the festival, the teens register at a motel to stay while waiting for their friend to be released by his family's lawyer. On her way to visit Billy, Cruz is chased by Three Finger who kills her. After Julian leaves the motel back to the police station, Gus is abducted by the cannibals while One Eye attempts to capture Lita but she manages to escape. Carter sees the cannibals drop Gus, who had his legs crippled. She attempts to save him, but the cannibals run him over with their pick-up truck, killing him. Carter frees Billy and gives him, Julian and prisoner Mose shotguns to guard the station while she sneaks into an appliance store to communicate radio jockey Teddy asking him to call for backup, but he rudely dismisses her message as a joke. After Lita manages to reach the police station, Billy and Julian left to search for Cruz despite Carter's objections. They wander the streets and find Cruz's dead body; while trying to get the body back to the station, they encounter the cannibals, who capture them and place them in a football pitch, where Three Finger kills both with a snow blower. Carter then sends Mose to search for the deputies, but he unknowingly runs over a barbed wire in the road and crashes. He awakens to find himself captured by the cannibals, who burn him alive. After hearing Mose's screams over the radio, Carter exits the station as Lita unwittingly releases Maynard, who stabs her eyes out. Carter finds her husband Jason bound in a car and tries to help him, but a sickle tied to the door guts his body as Three Finger fights the sheriff before overpowering and capturing her. Carter awakens in the jail cell with her hands tied to the ceiling. Maynard gives her the option of her death by fire or from a shotgun with the trigger tied to her feet. As they burn down the cell, Carter eventually triggers the shotgun, killing herself. Lita, unable to see, is captured by Maynard and the cannibals before being driven away into the woods, screaming.
