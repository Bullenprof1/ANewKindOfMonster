Hasashi kills them all after discovering that the Lin Kuei have slaughtered the rest of the Shirai Ryu, including his wife Harumi. The Lin Kuei's Grandmaster Sub-Zero appears, uses his freezing abilities to restrain Hanzo in ice and then murders Satoshi. He then impales Hanzo through the neck with an icicle, killing him. Deep below in the depths of the Netherrealm, Hasashi is mysteriously resurrected and meets with the sorcerer Quan Chi, who persuades Hanzo to fight for him in the Mortal Kombat tournament so that he can exact his revenge on Sub-Zero. Hanzo agrees, dubbing himself Scorpion. Meanwhile, the thunder god Raiden and the Shaolin monk Liu Kang make preparations to defend Earthrealm by participating in the Mortal Kombat tournament, hosted by the aging warlock Shang Tsung. The tournament's victor will battle Goro to decide the fate of Earthrealm. The pair are accompanied by out-of-work Hollywood actor Johnny Cage and Special Forces agent Sonya Blade, with both having their own reasons for participating: Sonya is in pursuit of Black Dragon crime syndicate leader Kano, and Johnny believes that he is participating in a film project. Upon arrival on Shang Tsung's island, Scorpion attempts to steal Shinnok's amulet on Quan Chi's orders, but Raiden persuades him not to follow through on the deal. Meanwhile, Cage, Liu, and Sonya witness Sonya's partner Jackson "Jax" Briggs being grievously injured by the tournament's champion Goro until Raiden intervenes. During the course of the tournament, Johnny barely claims victory over Baraka before realizing he’s in an actual tournament , Sonya successfully kills Reptile, and Liu fights Kitana, emerging as the winner when she yields. In an attempt to stop the Earthrealm heroes, Kano has his assassins infiltrate the island to kill them, but they are all killed by Scorpion. While attempting to fight Kano, Sub-Zero appears and helps deal with the assassins, but a vengeful Scorpion tackles him off a bridge into a spike pit, impaling them both and killing Sub-Zero. Johnny and Sonya pursue Kano in order to rescue Jax while Liu rushes to Shang Tsung's throne room. Quan Chi appears before Scorpion and reveals that he was directly responsible for the slaughter of the Shirai Ryu, having disguised himself as Sub-Zero and manipulated the Lin Kuei into doing his bidding, and that the real Sub-Zero had no part in the massacre. Enraged, Scorpion removes himself from the spike to exact revenge. At the climax of the tournament, Liu almost suffers the same fate as Jax during his match with Goro, but is saved when Scorpion kills Goro with his kunai, while Johnny, Sonya, and Jax successfully kill Kano. Shang Tsung attempts to have Scorpion fight Liu, but Scorpion takes Tsung hostage and willingly forfeits his status as a fighter, securing Liu's position as the victor of the tournament. After Shang Tsung retreats to Outworld, the island begins to collapse, with the Earthrealm heroes evacuating to a nearby boat, while Scorpion succeeds in killing Quan Chi in combat before joining his family and clan in the afterlife. In the aftermath, Shang Tsung is tortured by Shao Kahn for his failure before being ordered to make preparations for the invasion of Earthrealm.

You can help by adding to it. (April 2020) On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 19 reviews, with an average rating of 7.35/10.[9] Future[edit] Jeremy Adams expressed interest in doing a sequel and teased his vision about it: “Bigger,” Adams teases. “That’s all I can say about that. I absolutely do hope that happens. I don’t know anything else besides that. But yeah, my hope is that this gets a theatrical release at some point. I hope someday maybe they do like a Fathom event or something, just to get fans to go to the theater because I think it’d be a really fun audience participation thing.” [10] References[edit] ^ "Animated 'Mortal Kombat' Movie in the Works with Joel McHale". ^ Gary Miereanu (2020-01-30).
