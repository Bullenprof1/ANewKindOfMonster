Creature of Michigan folklore The Dewey Lake Monster, also known as the The Sister Lakes Sasquatch,[1] in Michigan folklore, is purported to be an ape-like creature, similar to descriptions of Bigfoot, that was allegedly sighted in the summer of 1964 near Dewey Lake and Sister Lakes in Dowagiac. Contents 1 Description 2 History 3 Popular culture 4 References Description[edit] The creature was described as covered in hair, approximately 10 feet (3 m) tall, 500 pounds (230 kilograms), and had glowing eyes.[2] History[edit] In June of 1964, the story gained national attention after local residents reported seeing a large, hairy creature with glowing eyes. Police searched the area of the alleged sightings and found nothing. Nevertheless, the reports caused curious thrill-seekers and monster-hunters to besiege the community that summer. Local entrepreneurs capitalized on the event by selling "monster getaway gas", "monster burgers" and "monster hunting kits" — with a net, flashlight, squirt gun, a mallet and a stake.[3][4] Several zoologists suggested that people may have misidentified a bear or gorilla. Cass County Sheriff Robert Dool and conservation officer William Rowe dismissed speculations of a monster.[4] Within a week, the hysteria diminished, and the South Bend Tribune reported that "nobody seems frightened anymore".[5] In a 1983 retrospective, the South Bend Tribune suggested that the monster was imagined by intoxicated strawberry pickers.[6] Steve Arseneau of the Dowagiac Area History Museum said, "I view it more as a rural legend. Perhaps some people saw something, and their imaginations got the better of them".[3] Popular culture[edit] In 2016, the annual Dewey Lake Boat Parade celebrated the Dewey Lake Monster legend.[7] Local brewery Sister Lakes Brewing named a beer after the Dewey Lake Monster.[8] References[edit] ^ "The legend of Dowagiac's Dewey Lake Monster". k1025.com.
