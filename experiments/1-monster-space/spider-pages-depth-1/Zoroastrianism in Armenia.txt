Prior to Armenia's Christianisation, it was a predominantly Zoroastrian-adhering land.[1] The yazatas Mithra (Mihr) and Verethragna (Vahagn) particularly enjoyed a high degree of reverence in the country.[2] Armenian Zoroastrian fire temple in the medieval Bagratid city of Ani Contents 1 History 2 See also 3 References 4 Sources History[edit] A number of Zoroastrian fire-altars had been discovered in Christian sanctuaries in Armenia.[3] In various parts of Armenia, Zoroastrianism lingered on for several centuries even after the official adoption of Christianity. The Arsacid dynasty of Armenia, under which Armenia eventually would become a Christian nation, were pious Zoroastrians who invoked Mithra as the lord of covenants, as is proper.[4] An episode which illustrates the Armenian Arsacids and their observance of the cult is the famous journey of Tiridates I to Rome in A.D. 65-66. The same aforementioned Tiridates I, brother of Vologases I of Parthia and founder of the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia, was a Zoroastrian magus or priest.[5][6] In A.D. 53 the Parthian Arsacid dynasty came into Armenia, the king, Trdat I, is thought to have done a great amount to spread Zoroastrianism in Armenia.[7] The Arsacid kings legitimized their rule through the authority of the Zoroastrian deity (yazata) Verethragna, the god of victory.[8] According to J. Russel, Zurvanism was the form of Zoroastrianism under Yazdagrird II (438-57), which he promoted in Persian Armenia.[9] The Armenian month names show influence of the Zoroastrian calendar. An Armenian Christian source, according to which an Zurvanite proselytizer, Mihr Narseh, spoke of the words openly: 'We do not worship, like you, the elements, the sun, the moon, the winds and the fire.'[10] Reports indicate that there were Zoroastrian Armenians in Armenia until the 1920s.[11] See also[edit] Battle of Avarayr Armenian mythology Satrapy of Armenia Arsacid dynasty of Armenia Persian Armenia Marzpanate Armenia References[edit] ^ Boyce, Mary.

Three years later, Tiridates made the journey to Rome. As a magus or priest of the Zoroastrian faith, he had to observe the rites which forbade him to defile water by travelling.

In 62 A.C. the Parthian king Vologases (Valakhsh) put his younger brother Tiridates on the Armenian throne, and this cadet branch of the Arsacids ruled there into the Sasanian period. Tiridates was himself a strictly observant Zoroastrian - Roman sources even call him a Magus - and there is no doubt that during the latter period of the Parthian period Armenia was a predominantly Zoroastrian adhering land. ^ The Heritage of Armenian Literature, Volume I - Agop Jack Hacikyan Gabriel Basmajian Edward S.
