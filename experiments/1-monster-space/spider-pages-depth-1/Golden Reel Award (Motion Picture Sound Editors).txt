The society's goals are to educate others about and increase the recognition of the sound editors, show the artistic merit of the soundtracks, and improve the professional relationship of its members. The society is not to be confused with an industry union, such as the I.A.T.S.E. The current president is Mark Lanza. The names of active members of the MPSE will generally appear in film credits with the post-nominal letters "MPSE".
