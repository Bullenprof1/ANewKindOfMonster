Many crime thrillers, action films, and slasher films contain softcore sex and/or nudity but are not erotic thrillers. Likewise, if a film is not identifiably a thriller, it is probably not an erotic thriller but simply a work of softcore erotica[4] or perhaps even erotic melodrama.[5] Contents 1 Precursors to the erotic thriller 2 List of films: 1940–1970 2.1 1944 2.2 1958 2.3 1962 2.4 1966 2.5 1969 3 List of films: 1970–1980 3.1 1971 3.2 1972 3.3 1973 3.4 1974 3.5 1975 3.6 1976 3.7 1977 3.8 1978 4 List of films: 1980–1990 4.1 1980 4.2 1981 4.3 1982 4.4 1983 4.5 1984 4.6 1985 4.7 1986 4.8 1987 4.9 1988 4.10 1989 5 List of films: 1990–1996 5.1 1990 5.2 1991 5.3 1992 5.4 1993 5.5 1994 5.6 1995 5.7 1996 6 List of films: 1997–2007 6.1 1997 6.2 1998 6.3 1999 6.4 2000 6.5 2001 6.6 2002 6.7 2003 6.8 2004 6.9 2005 6.10 2006 6.11 2007 7 List of films: 2008–present 7.1 2008 7.2 2009 7.3 2010 7.4 2011 7.5 2012 7.6 2013 7.7 2014 7.8 2015 7.9 2016 7.10 2017 7.11 2018 7.12 2021 8 Miscellaneous crossover films 9 Post-period crossover films 10 References Precursors to the erotic thriller[edit] The late 1980s to the mid-1990s are regarded as the "classic period" of the erotic thriller.[6] In his book Hollywood’s Dark Cinema: The American Film Noir, Robert Barton Palmer claimed “perhaps the most popular genre in the 1990s, the so-called erotic thriller [...] is a direct descendant of the classic film noir”.[7] However, many films of the 1960s and 70s also provocatively mixed noir themes with softcore sex, erotic fantasy, and voyeurism.[8] Some of these films are so close to what are now defined as erotic thrillers, it is likely their video box covers, if they had them at the time of their release, would be indistinguishable alongside 1990s erotic thrillers on a shelf at Blockbuster Video.[9] When the word "erotic" began to adhere to "thriller" during the 1980s to describe a sudden boom in noir-like thriller films with sexually provocative content,[10] a new genre began to take shape.
