After the credits, Bambi looks up to see Godzilla's foot coming down, squashing him flat (set to the final chord of The Beatles' "A Day in the Life" slowed down to half-speed). After a moment, the closing credits appear alongside the image of Godzilla's foot atop Bambi.[5] The closing credits give grateful acknowledgement to the city of Tokyo "for their help in obtaining Godzilla for this film". Godzilla's toe claws wiggle once and the cartoon ends. Screenings and distribution[edit] In 1973, Bambi Meets Godzilla was paired with John Magnuson's Thank You Mask Man by Randy Finley and Specialty Films in Seattle and released widely under the title The King of Hearts and His Loyal Short Subjects.[6][7] The program ran in repertory theaters across America for several years.[8] The short was also included on VHS home video releases of Godzilla 1985 and Fantastic Animation Festival.[9][10] Sequels and remakes[edit] In 1976, sequel Bambi's Revenge was released.[11] In 1999, sequel Son of Bambi Meets Godzilla was released.[12] In 2013, animator Coda Gardner did a meticulous frame-by-frame recreation of the original via tracing the film frames and assembling the animation via digital video editing.[4][13] Preservation[edit] The Academy Film Archive preserved Bambi Meets Godzilla in 2009.[2] See also[edit] Bring Me the Head of Charlie Brown Escalation Mickey Mouse in Vietnam References[edit] ^ A "Bambi Meets Godzilla" Live Action Remake|IndieWire ^ a b "Preserved Projects".
