In Greek mythology, Ioke /aɪˈoʊkiː/ (Ἰωκή) is the female personification of onslaught, battle-tumult, and pursuit. In the Iliad, she is one of the daimones, or spirits, of Zeus's aegis. The other daimones are Phobos, Eris, and Alke.[1] The ancient Greek word ἰωκή is a rare doublet for διωκή "rout, pursuit" from the common verb διώκω "drive, pursue, chase away".[2] References[edit] ^ Homer, Iliad, 5. 738 ff ^ H.
