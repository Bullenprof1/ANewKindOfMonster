Eucleia or Eukleia (Greek: Ευκλεια) was the ancient Greek female personification of glory and good repute.[1] Along with her sisters, Eupheme, Philophrosyne and Euthenia, she was likely regarded as a member of the younger Charites.[2] According to Plutarch, Eucleia may have also been used as an epithet of Artemis.[3] According to an Orphic rhapsody fragment, Eucleia's parents were Hephaestus and Aglaea.[2] Alternatively, Plutarch stated that Eucleia was sometimes considered a separate goddess and the daughter of Heracles and Myrto, and as she died a virgin, she came to be venerated as a goddess.[3] In Greek vase paintings, particularly from 5th century Athens, Eucleia is frequently shown among the attendants of Aphrodite, where she represents the good repute of a chaste bride or is performing stereotypically feminine tasks.[4][1] She was also referred by ancient Greek author Bacchylides as "garland-loving".[5] Cult in Greece and Macedonia[edit] Eucleia was worshipped in Locris and Boeotia.[6] Plutarch states that all cities in these areas had an image and alter of her, and this is where brides and grooms would perform a sacrifice.[3] At Thebes, her statue was created by Skopas.[7] In Athens, a temple was dedicated to Artemis-Eucleia in honor of those who fought in the Battle of Marathon, which is referenced by Greek author Plutarch and Roman geographer Pausanias.[3][8] It is likely that Eucleia was worshipped together with Eunomia at Athens, as they were served by one priest.[9] In Paros and Epiros, military generals (stratêgoi) offered dedications to Eucleia along with Aphrodite, Zeus (Aphrodisios), Hermes, and Artemis.[10] There was a sanctuary dedicated to Eucleia at Aigai (Aegae), the ancient capital of Macedonia.[11] The sanctuary consisted of a 4th century Doric temple, a small Hellenistic era temple, and two stoas.[7] At least two statute bases were votive offerings by Eurydice, paternal grandmother of Alexander the Great; it has been suggested that these offerings were made to commemorate Philip II's victory at Chaeronea in 338 B.C.E.[7] It is possible that there was a statue of Eucliea in the sanctuary.[7] In the area surround the sanctuary, at least three burials of significant people, who were crowned with golden oak leaf wreathes, have been discovered.[12] Notes[edit] ^ a b Smith, Amy C.
