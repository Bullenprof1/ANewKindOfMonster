In Greek mythology, Apheleia[pronunciation?] (Ἀφέλεια) was the spirit and personification of ease, simplicity and primitivity in the good sense, "the good old days". According to Eustathius, she had an altar at the Acropolis of Athens and was honored as a nurse of Athena.[1] References[edit] ^ Eustathius on Homer, p. 1279, 39 ff (commenting on Iliad, 22. 451); he erroneously cites Pausanias, who does have a catalogue of personifications honored in Athens (1. 17. 1), but makes no mention of Apheleia.
