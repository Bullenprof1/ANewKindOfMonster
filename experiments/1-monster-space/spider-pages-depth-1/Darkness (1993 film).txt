From the shadows of the night a legion of human-like bloodthirsty vampires breaks. The boys arm themselves to the teeth with chainsaws, machetes, guns and holy water. A pitched battle between the living and the undead is prepared. When the dawn is near, all eyes of humanity head towards a face that overwhelms even the dead. Cast[edit] Gary Miller as Tobe Randall Aviks as Liven Mike Gisick as Greg Cena Donham as Kelly Steve Brown as Jodie Lisa Franz as Dianne Bill Hooper as Glenn Production[edit] Jonker wrote the script when he was 17 years old and began production a year later, in 1988. After four days of shooting, he abandoned the production. He returned to it in 1989 with a new cast and a budget under $5000. Jonker finished post-production in 1991, two and a half years after he began it.[2] Reception[edit] Bloody Disgusting rated it 3/5 stars and called it a "diamond in the rough" that has attained a cult following for its gore.[3] Scott Weinberg of DVD Talk rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, "Lief Jonker's Darkness is one of the cheapest, silliest, and splatteriest no-budget horror flicks you're ever likely to come across.".[4] Brett Cullum of DVD Verdict wrote, "Despite any shortcomings, this is a movie made by horror film fans for their peers. You can feel the passion seeping off the screen, and somehow a movie that should be fodder for the Mystery Science Theater 3000 becomes a rollicking good time."[5] Horrorhound.com named it "the goriest vampire film of all time".[1] References[edit] ^ a b Pocowatchit, Rod (2012-02-19).
