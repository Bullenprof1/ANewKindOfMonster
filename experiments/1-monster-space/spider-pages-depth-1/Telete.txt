In Greek mythology, Telete /ˈtɛlɪtiː/ was the daughter of Dionysus and Nicaea. Concerning Telete's birth, it is related that Nicaea was ashamed of having been made pregnant by Dionysus, and even attempted to hang herself; nevertheless, in due time a daughter was born to her. The Horae were said to have served as midwives at Telete's birth.[1] Telete was destined by Dionysus to become a follower of himself and his son Iacchus, her half-brother.[2] Pausanias mentions a statue of Telete in the sanctuary of the Heliconian Muses in Boeotia. Her image was next to that of Orpheus.[3] Telete was associated with nighttime festivities and ritual dances in honor of Dionysus,[4] and has been interpreted as a goddess of initiation into the Bacchic rites.[5] References[edit] ^ Nonnus, Dionysiaca, 16. 392-400 ^ Nonnus, Dionysiaca, 48. 884-885 ^ Pausanias, Description of Greece, 9. 30. 4 ^ Nonnus, Dionysiaca, 16. 400-402 ^ Theoi Project - Telete This article relating to a Greek deity is a stub.
