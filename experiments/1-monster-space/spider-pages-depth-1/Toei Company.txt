(東映株式会社, Tōei Kabushiki-gaisha) (/toʊ.eɪ/) (also styled TOEI) is a Japanese film, television production, and distribution and video game developer and publishing company. Based in Tokyo, Toei owns and operates thirty-four movie theaters across Japan (all but two of them operated by its subsidiary, T-Joy), studios at Tokyo and Kyoto; and is a shareholder in several television companies. It is notable for creating animated programming known as anime, and live action dramas known as tokusatsu which use special visual effects. It also creates historical dramas (jidaigeki). Outside Japan, it is known as the controlling shareholder of Toei Animation and the owner of the Kamen Rider and Super Sentai franchises. Toei is one of the four members of the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan (MPPAJ), and is therefore one of Japan's Big Four film studios. The name "Toei" is derived from the company's former name "Tōkyō Eiga Haikyū" (東京映画配給, Tokyo Film Distribution Company).

(東横映画, Tō-Yoko Eiga, "Toyoko Films"), was incorporated in 1938. It was founded by Keita Goto, which was CEO of Tokyo-Yokohama Electric Railway (東京横浜電鉄, Tōkyō-Yokohama Dentetsu), the direct predecessor to the Tokyu Corporation. It had erected its facilities immediately east of the Tōkyū Tōyoko Line; they managed the Tōkyū Shibuya Yokohama studio system prior to V-J Day. From 1945 through the Toei merger, Tokyo-Yokohama Films leased from the Daiei Motion Picture Company a second studio in Kyoto. Through the merger, they gained the combined talents and experience of actors Chiezō Kataoka, Utaemon Ichikawa, Ryunosuke Tsukigata, Ryūtarō Ōtomo, Kinnosuke Nakamura, Chiyonosuke Azuma, Shirunosuke Toshin, Hashizo Okawa, and Satomi Oka. On October 1, 1950, the Tokyo Film Distribution Company was incorporated as a subsidiary of Toyoko Eiga; in 1951 the company purchased Ōizumi Films. The current iteration of Toei was established on 1 April 1951. In 1956, Toei established an animation division, Toei Animation Company, Limited at the former Tokyo-Ōizumi animation studio, purchasing the assets of Japan Animated Films (日本動画映画, Nihon Dōga Eiga, often shortened to 日動映画 (Nichidō Eiga)), founded in 1948. Toei was a pioneer in the use of "Henshin"/"character transformation" in live-action martial-arts dramas, a technique developed for the Kamen Rider, Metal Hero and Super Sentai series; the genre currently continues with Kamen Rider and Super Sentai. Toei was also the exclusive distributor for 20th Century Fox movies in Japan, until Fox's acquisition by Disney, which completed in 2019. Toei films[edit] This list compiles the films by their original release date, their common English titles and Japanese titles. The Japanese titles are not necessarily direct translations of their English counterparts. For feature films, Toei established itself as a producer of B-movies, that were made to fit into double bills and triple bills.[4][5] It is predominantly known in the west for its series of action films and television series.[5] Release date English film title Original title Notes Ref(s) 1954 Weak-kneed from Fear of Ghost-Cat Kaibyo koshinuke daisodo [6] 1956 The Phantom Cat N/A [7] 1956 The Swamp Kaidan Chidoriga-fuchi [8] 1957 Ghost Story of Broken Dishes at Bancho Mansion Kaidan Bancho sara yashiki [9] 1958 Ghost-Cat of Karakuri Tenjo Kaibyo Karakuri Tenjo [6] March 19, 1959 Planet Prince Yusei oji Chapter 1 [10] May 26, 1959 Planet Prince Yusei oji Chapter 2 [10] 1959 Ghost from the Pond Kaidan hitotsu-me Jizo [11] October 19, 1959 The Final War Daisanji sekai taisen - yonju-ichi jikan no kyofu A New Toei Co, Ltd.

The use of the pen name began with The Kagestar and has been used throughout the Super Sentai (in the adapted Power Rangers series starting with Ninja Storm, the credits list Saburo Hatte. Before this, the credits listed "Original Concepts by Saburo Yatsude") and Metal Hero Series as well as for Spider-Man, Choukou Senshi Changéríon, Video Warrior Laserion, Chōdenji Robo Combattler V, Chōdenji Machine Voltes V, Tōshō Daimos, Daltanius, Space Emperor God Sigma, Beast King GoLion, Kikou Kantai Dairugger XV and Laserion. The name is also used as a contributor to the soundtracks for the series. Toei Animation stopped using Saburo Yatsude in 1999, and they began to use Izumi Todo instead. The first anime that was created by Izumi Todo was Ojamajo Doremi. In the Unofficial Sentai Akibaranger series, Saburo Hatte is an actual person who is godlike within the fictional reality that the show takes place in. In fact, his hand appears at the end of the first half of the series to cover the camera lens and end the show, later having the second half be made under Malseena's influence while in the hospital in the real world. In the Doubutsu Sentai Zyuohger spinoff, Super Animal War's third episode, he is portrayed by Jun Hikasa. On April 3, 2016, an unknown Toei staff member going by Saburo Yatsude was interviewed while wearing a "Giraffe Zyuman" mask in reference to Zyuohger.[45] See also[edit] Companies portal Toho Shintoho Tsuburaya Productions Daiei Film Kadokawa Daiei Studio Nikkatsu Shochiku Studio Ghibli Topcraft Toei Animation Toei Superheroes Toei Fushigi Comedy Series References[edit] Footnotes[edit] ^ https://www.toei.co.jp/company/info/outline/ ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m "TOEI GROUP" (in Japanese). toei.co.jp.
