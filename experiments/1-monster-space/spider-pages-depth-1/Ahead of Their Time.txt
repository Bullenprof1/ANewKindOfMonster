Contents 1 Performances 2 Track listing 3 Personnel 4 References 5 External links Performances[edit] The first part of the set is a one-off performance of a musical play retrospectively entitled Progress?, and featuring members of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Portions of this performance originally found their way on to the Mystery Disc (1998) contained on the second 1986 box of The Old Masters and the Honker Home Video release of Uncle Meat (1969). Much of the humor and storyline of the play is lost to the casual listener due to primitive recording techniques and the visual nature of some of the performance, necessitating extensive liner notes by Zappa. According to Zappa's liner notes, the remainder of the set is "A fair – not outstanding – 1968 Mothers of Invention rock concert performance". Different edits of snatches from the second part of the performance ("The Orange County Lumber Truck" and "Prelude to the Afternoon of a Sexually Aroused Gas Mask") were originally released on Weasels Ripped My Flesh (1970). "Holiday in Berlin" also appears on Burnt Weeny Sandwich (1970). Track listing[edit] All tracks written, composed and arranged by Frank Zappa. "Progress?" No. Title Length 1. "Prologue" 3:07 2.
