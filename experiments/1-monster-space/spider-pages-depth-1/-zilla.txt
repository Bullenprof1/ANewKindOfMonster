Suffix For other uses, see Zilla. Look up -zilla in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. -zilla is an English slang suffix, a back-formation derived from the English name of the Japanese movie monster Godzilla.[1][2] It is popular for the names of software and websites. It is also found often in popular culture to imply some form of excess, denoting the monster-like qualities of Godzilla. This trend has been observed since the popularization of the Mozilla Project, which itself included the Internet Relay Chat client ChatZilla.[3] The use of the suffix was contested by Toho, owners of the trademark Godzilla, in a lawsuit against the website Davezilla[4] and also against Sears for their mark Bagzilla.[5] Toho has since trademarked the word "Zilla" and retroactively used it as an official name for the "Godzilla In Name Only" creature from the 1998 Roland Emmerich film.[6] Contents 1 List of items ending in -zilla 1.1 Businesses and products 1.2 Entertainment 1.3 Miscellaneous 1.4 For derived words 2 References List of items ending in -zilla[edit] Some uses of the suffix -zilla include: Businesses and products[edit] AmiZilla, an Amiga port of Mozilla Firefox Chipzilla, a humorous epithet for the Intel Corporation Clonezilla, an open source disk cloning software FileZilla, an FTP program Go!Zilla, a download manager program Hubzilla, an open source social network, part of Fediverse Mozilla, a group of Internet-related programs created by the Mozilla Foundation, also name of the group's widely known web browser Bugzilla, open source bug tracking software, with a web-based interface.
