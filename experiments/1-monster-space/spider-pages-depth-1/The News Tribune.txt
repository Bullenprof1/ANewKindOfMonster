The News Tribune is a daily newspaper in Tacoma, Washington, in the United States. Contents 1 History 2 Criticism 3 See also 4 References 5 External links History[edit] The newspaper can trace its origins back to the founding of the weekly Tacoma Ledger by R.F. Radebaugh in 1880. The next year, H.C. Patrick founded The News, another weekly. Both papers became dailies in 1883.[2] In 1898, Radebaugh and Patrick sold their papers to S.A. Perkins. Radebaugh re-entered the market in 1907 with the debut of the Tacoma Tribune. He exited five years later with the sale of the Tribune to Frank S. and Elbert H. Baker. The Bakers then purchased The News and the Tacoma Ledger in 1918, and all three papers were combined into the Tacoma News Tribune and Ledger.[3] In 1948, the paper began operating the radio stations KTNT-AM and KTNT-FM, and began operating a television station with the same call letters in 1953. In 1972, KTNT-FM's call letters were changed to KNBQ, which became KBSG in 1988, and KIRO-FM in 2008. Two years later, the television station was sold and its call letters changed to KSTW, which is now an owned-and-operated station of The CW.[citation needed] In 1979, the newspaper adopted the name Tacoma News Tribune. Its parent bought the Pierce County Herald in 1983. In 1986, the Tribune Publishing Company's newspaper assets were bought by McClatchy Newspapers.[citation needed] The News Tribune published as The Morning News Tribune from April 6, 1987 to October 4, 1993, when "Morning" was dropped from its name.[citation needed] As of 2001 the News Tribune was the third largest newspaper in Washington, with a daily circulation of 130,000.[4] The newspaper, alongside sister publication The Olympian, were printed at a plant in Tacoma until February 3, 2019.[5] Since that time, the two newspapers have been printed at the facilities of The Columbian in Vancouver, Washington.[5] Criticism[edit] Former Tribune subscriber Harriet Hall writes in 2019 about her frustration with "advertisements for bogus health-related products deceptively presented as news stories" in the Tribune. Though they include the words "paid advertisement", it is in small print and easy to overlook. Hall wrote, "In every other way - format, typeface, appearance, reporter byline, pictures, organizational affiliations, and so on - these fake news stories are indistinguishable from real news stories". After Hall realized that the paper had raised their rate to $3 a day she cancelled her subscription.[6] See also[edit] Journalism portal References[edit] ^ "McClatchy / The News Tribune". 2017. ^ "The Editor and Publisher 1913-10-25: Vol 13 Iss 19".
