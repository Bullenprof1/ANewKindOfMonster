Death genres? Even the "film genres" page makes no reference to either. 68.144.92.199 (talk) 18:34, 4 June 2011 (UTC)Tyrannorabbit I agree. I have updated the template to reflect groupings that are more consistent with how genres are discussed. Osubuckeyeguy (talk) 00:20, 24 June 2011 (UTC) Nudity in film[edit] In what way is Nudity in film a Film genre? קולנואני (talk) 22:42, 17 August 2011 (UTC) If you read the linked article, you'll see that nudist fims and nudie-cuties are recognized types of exploitation films popularized in the U.S. I have updated the link so it takes people directly to these sections. Osubuckeyeguy (talk) 06:32, 18 August 2011 (UTC) Okay. All clear now. Thanks :) קולנואני (talk) 21:33, 18 August 2011 (UTC) Audience, Format or Production[edit] It should be noted that target audience, film format or type of production have nothing to do with a film's genre, since a genre is categorization of narrative elements. קולנואני (talk) 22:45, 17 August 2011 (UTC) The definition of a "film genre" is difficult to pin down since there are lots of interpretations of what that term means (the article on this topic notes that some film theorists do not consider audience and format to be genres, as you suggest, but common usage of this term does often include these factors. The template has been designed to be inclusive, rather than exclusive, consistent with the approach in the main article. Osubuckeyeguy (talk) 06:32, 18 August 2011 (UTC) To my knowledge, these types are refetred to as "non-genres", instead of "genres". קולנואני (talk) 21:32, 18 August 2011 (UTC) Semi-protected edit request on 17 June 2018[edit] Error: Protected edit requests can only be made on the talk page.

It is not for use except on Project pages. CapnZapp (talk) 17:09, 24 August 2020 (UTC) Mess[edit] We've got Comedy(Bromantic), Comedy(Romantic) and Romantic(Comedy(Bromantic)); Comedy(Thriller) and Thriller(Comedy) etc etc. It's basically unreadable and confusing whether looking for a specific genre or just browsing them all. Needs a serious rethink. ----Pontificalibus 11:45, 3 October 2020 (UTC) If no one objects I'm going to cut the template down to first-order genres (remove everything in brackets). This template is supposed to aid navigation but it's far too long, confusing and repetitious and is really a bad way of listing sub genres. Also, it has far more genres than List of genres#Film and television formats and genres and bares little relation to Category:Film genres. There may be ways that lots sub-genres could be listed in a template or multiple templates, but that would require a fundamental redesign. In the meanwhile this needs to be made usable.----Pontificalibus 07:32, 5 October 2020 (UTC) Semi-protected edit request on 11 March 2021[edit] Error: Protected edit requests can only be made on the talk page. The film genre "Horror" in the template film genres is linked to "Comedy Horror". Change link to "Horror film" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film) Rohfle (talk) 23:34, 11 March 2021 (UTC) The navbox is kind of confusing: that link is actually a subheading of "comedy". A reorganizing might be helpful here. ◢  Ganbaruby!  (Say hi!) 00:23, 12 March 2021 (UTC)
