The Bergsrå (Mountain Rå), Bergatrollet (Mountain Troll) or Bergakungen (Mountain King) was a mythical creature of the mountain in Norse mythology. The bergrå could be either masculine or feminine. It lived in the mountain with a court of relatives and sometimes surrounded by trolls. It was a common phenomena in the mythology about the bergsrå to trick people into their dwellings in the mountain and to become bergtagen (literary: "taken into the mountain"). A typical description of such a claimed occurrence was given by Sven Andersson in 1691, when he was on trial for having sexual intercourse with a female bergrå.[1] See also[edit] Rå References[edit] ^ Grimberg, Carl; Åberg, Alf (1960).
