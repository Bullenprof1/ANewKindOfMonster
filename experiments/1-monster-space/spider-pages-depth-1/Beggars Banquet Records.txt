Contents 1 History 2 See also 3 References 4 External links History[edit] In 1977, spurred by the prevailing DIY aesthetics of the British punk rock movement (then at the height of its popularity), Martin Mills and Nick Austin founded a record label to release records under the Beggars Banquet imprint.[1] The first band on the label was the English punk group the Lurkers; the first release on the label was the Lurkers' 7" single "Shadow"/"Love Story".[1] They also released the first solo "Duffo" album from Australian big-band vocalist Jeff Duff. Later in the decade and into the early 1980s, hits with Tubeway Army and Gary Numan secured the label's future.[1] See also[edit] List of record labels List of independent UK record labels Beggars Group References[edit] ^ a b c Colin Larkin (1992).
