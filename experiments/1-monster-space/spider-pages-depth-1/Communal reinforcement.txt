Often, the concept or idea may be further reinforced by publications in the mass media, books, or other means of communication. The phrase "millions of people can't all be wrong" is indicative of the common tendency to accept a communally reinforced idea without question, which often aids in the widespread acceptance of factoids. A very similar term to this term is community-reinforcement, which is a behavioral method to stop drug addiction.[2] Contents 1 In addiction treatment 2 In other applications 3 See also 4 References In addiction treatment[edit] The community-reinforcement approach (CRA) is a behaviourist alcoholism treatment approach that aims to achieve abstinence by eliminating positive reinforcement for drinking and enhancing positive reinforcement for sobriety. CRA integrates several treatment components, including building the client's motivation to quit drinking, helping the client initiate sobriety, analyzing the client's drinking pattern, increasing positive reinforcement, learning new coping behaviors, and involving significant others in the recovery process. These components can be adjusted to the individual client's needs to achieve optimal treatment outcome. In addition, treatment outcome can be influenced by factors such as therapist style and initial treatment intensity. Several studies have provided evidence for CRA's effectiveness in achieving abstinence. Furthermore, CRA has been successfully integrated with a variety of other treatment approaches, such as family therapy and motivational interviewing, and has been tested in the treatment of other drug abuse.[3] Community reinforcement and family training (CRAFT) is an adaptation of CRA that is aimed at giving the Concerned Significant Others (CSOs) of alcoholics skills to help them get the alcoholic into treatment. In other applications[edit] In Chris E. Stout's book The Psychology of Terrorism: Theoretical Understandings and Perspective, Stout explains how community reinforcement is present in the psychotic state of terrorists. "The individual would feel less charged, validated, courageous, sanctified, and zealous, and would feel exposed as an individual." It is believed that the group mentality of a terrorist organization solidifies the mission of the group through communal reinforcement. Members are more likely to stay dedicated and follow through with the event of terror if they receive support from fellow terrorist members. An individual might abandon the mission in terror, but with the reinforcement of his peers, a member is more likely to stay involved.[4] See also[edit] Psychology portal Society portal Argumentum ad populum, also known as Appeal to the population – Fallacy of claiming the majority is always correct Asch conformity experiments – Study of if and how individuals yielded to or defied a majority group Bandwagon effect Indoctrination List of common misconceptions – Wikipedia list article Collective consciousness – Shared beliefs and ideas in society Confirmation bias – Tendency of people to favor information that confirms their beliefs or values Conformity – The act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to group norms Crowd manipulation Foot-in-the-door technique Groupthink – A psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people Group polarization Meme – thought or idea that can be shared, in analogy to a gene Overton window – Range of ideas tolerated in public discourse Peer pressure – Affecting peers to change and follow the influencers Selective exposure theory – Theory in psychology referring to the tendency to favor information which reinforces pre-existing views Social constructionism – Theory that shared understandings of the world create shared assumptions about reality Social proof – Psychological phenomenon regarding conformity Spiral of silence Truthiness – Quality of preferring concepts or facts one wishes to be true, rather than actual truth References[edit] ^ The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions, p. 80, at Google Books ^ Introduction to Addictive Behaviors, p. 149, at Google Books ^ "Archived copy".
