His granddaughter Libya in turn became mother to Belus and Agenor. These sons then married (presumably) younger daughters of his son Nilus named Anchiroe[3] and Telephassa respectively. A daughter Chione[4] was said to be borne to Nilus and Callirhoe, an Oceanid. His other children include: Argiope,[5] Anippe,[6] Eurryroe, Europa[7] and possibly Caliadne, Polyxo and Thebe.[8] Mythology[edit] Parentage[edit] Hesiod, Theogony: And Tethys bore to Ocean eddying rivers, Nilus, and Alpheus, and deep-swirling Eridanus.

[N.B. Libya was the ancient Greek name for the continent of Africa.] Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca: Belos (Belus) [grandson of Epaphos] remained to become king of Aigyptos (Egypt), and married Neilos' daughter Ankhinoe (Anchinoe), who gave him twin sons, Aigyptos (Aegyptus) and Danaus. Pseudo-Plutarch, Greek and Roman Parallel Stories: Bousiris (Busiris), the son of Poseidon and Anippe, daughter of Neilos ... So says Agathon of Samos.
