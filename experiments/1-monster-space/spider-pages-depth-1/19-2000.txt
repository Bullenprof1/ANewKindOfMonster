It was the second single from the album, released on 26 June 2001 in the United Kingdom.

Mendis was asked to remix a track off the album in the hope that it would give it crossover potential, in the same way as the Ed Case remix of "Clint Eastwood" had.[3] Mendis was given a copy of all their demos and finished tracks for the album, being told to "pick [a song] that you can produce, remix or whatever into a hit single". Mendis was unsure which track to choose, and only when he was told that Jamie Hewlett was already working on the video for "19-2000", did he make his decision.[3] Tina Weymouth[4] and Miho Hatori[5] contributed backing vocals to "19-2000", whilst Damon Albarn performed the vocals on the verses. Music video[edit] The video, directed by Jamie Hewlett and Pete Candeland, is animated, both in 2-D and 3-D. It features Gorillaz riding in their Geep (as mentioned in the 2005 MTV Cribs episode, featuring the Gorillaz) along a twisted highway, encountering roller coaster style loops, a killer UFO, when Murdoc decides not to take an exit leading toward a church, and a giant moose. Murdoc tries to blow up the moose with a pair of missiles, but the moose sneezes right before impact, sending them back to the car, which explodes and skids along the highway on fire. The members of Gorillaz appear to have black ash all over them from the blast. In between these various encounters the Gorillaz pass and perform things in time with the rhythm—such as a field of nodding donkeys, or the light posts passing them at the beginning, and a couple of sections where the buggy does several versions of the wheelie (including side wheelies, otherwise known as Skiing) and even appears to break the sound barrier. There are two versions of this video, one to fit the original mix and one to fit the Soulchild remix. The videos are almost identical, except for a few minor changes in order for the two songs to sync up with the video. On the motorway, there are signs to Amity, a reference to Jaws, the Overlook Hotel, a reference to The Shining, and Camp Crystal, a reference to Friday the 13th. It was shown in the MTV Cribs tour of Kong Studios that the buggy actually survived the blast, and now sits in the Kong Studio's parking lot.[6] Track listings[edit] UK enhanced CD single[7] "19-2000" – 3:30 "19-2000" (Soulchild remix) – 3:29 "Left Hand Suzuki Method" – 3:12 "19-2000" (The Making of the Video: "Realising the Dream") – 4:48 UK and European 12-inch single[8] A1.
