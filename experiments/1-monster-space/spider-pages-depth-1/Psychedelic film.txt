Psychedelic films typically contain visual distortion and experimental narratives, often emphasizing psychedelic imagery. They might reference drugs directly, or merely present a distorted reality resembling the effects of psychedelic drugs. Their experimental narratives often purposefully try to distort the viewers' understanding of reality or normality.[1][2] Contents 1 Subgenres 2 Film examples 3 Television show examples 4 See also 5 References Subgenres[edit] The Acid Western was a style of Western popular in the 1960s and 1970s that use psychedelic imagery or allusions.[3] Film examples[edit] Un Chien Andalou, 1929[4] Fantasia, 1940 Dumbo, 1941 The Red Shoes, 1948[5] Alice in Wonderland, 1951 Vertigo, 1958 Looking for Toxin X, 1962 Mary Poppins, 1964 Daisies, 1966[6] Fantastic Voyage, 1966 Point Blank, 1967[7] 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968[8] Barbarella, 1968 El Topo, 1970 Performance, 1970 Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, 1971 The Devils, 1971[9] A Clockwork Orange, 1971 The Devil, 1972[10] Behind the Green Door, 1972[11] Fritz the Cat, 1972 Heavy Traffic, 1973 Fantastic Planet, 1973[12] The Holy Mountain, 1973 The Wicker Man, 1973[13] Zardoz, 1974 Tommy, 1975 The Man Who Fell to Earth, 1976 3 Women, 1977[14] Hausu, 1977 Suspiria, 1977[15] Nosferatu the Vampyre, 1979[16] Altered States, 1980 Son of the White Mare, 1981[17] Pink Floyd – The Wall, 1982 Dune, 1984 Come and See, 1985[18] Natural Born Killers, 1994 Dead Man, 1995[19] Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, 1998 Requiem for a Dream, 2000[20] Enter the Void, 2009 Beyond the Black Rainbow, 2010 A Field in England, 2013[21] Upstream Color, 2013 Doctor Strange, 2016 The Love Witch, 2016 Woodshock, 2017 Annihilation, 2018 Climax, 2018 Mandy, 2018 Midsommar, 2019 The Lighthouse, 2019 Color Out of Space, 2019 Lux Aeterna, 2019 Psychedelic counterculture era films include: Riot on Sunset Strip, 1967 The Love-Ins, 1967 The Trip, 1967 Magical Mystery Tour, 1967 Head, 1968 Psych-Out, 1968 Candy, 1968 Wonderwall, 1968 Yellow Submarine, 1968[22] Wild in the Streets, 1968 I Love You, Alice B.
