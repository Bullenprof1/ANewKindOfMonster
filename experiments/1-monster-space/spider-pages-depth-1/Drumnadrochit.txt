The village lies on the A82 road, near a junction with the A831, adjoining the villages of Milton to the west and Lewiston to the south. The local hill-come-tourist attraction is called Craigmonie.[3] Historically it was within the local government county of Inverness (until 1975) and the Inverness district of the Highland local government region (1975 to 1996). In 2006 the village hall, originally funded by Bradley Martin of Balmacaan House, celebrated its centenary.[4] Drumnadrochit is served by the local Glen Urquhart High School which is also home to the community library.[5] The local shops include the Great Glen Pharmacy, the Post Office and shop, and a ScotMid Cooperative Supermarket There is a doctor's surgery and a team of local Community First Responders cover nights and weekends in serious emergencies. There is also an RNLI Loch Ness crew who attend to emergencies on the local Loch. The village is home to shinty team Glenurquhart Shinty Club. Also, there is a Bowls Club and Badminton. Glenurquhart Shinty Club House & Enclosure Transport[edit] There are several buses a day that pass through Drumnadrochit, notably the 17 between Drum and Inverness bus station. Buses are less frequent outside the summer season, especially on a Sunday. Agriculture and tourism[edit] The village is popular with tourists and there are three larger hotels in (or close to) the village, two smaller inns (the Ben Leva Hotel and Fiddler's Rest) and a cosy hostel (the Loch Ness Backpackers Lodge). Attractions include the nearby Urquhart Castle, one of the most visited sites managed by Historic Scotland and Nessieland, and a "Nessie" themed exhibition about the Loch Ness Monster, the Loch Ness Centre and Exhibition for those wanting a more serious interpretation. The village hosts the Glenurquhart Highland Games at the end of August each year. A winter event, "Drums and Rockets", has also taken place in recent years.[6] The community hosts a Bonfire Night fireworks display around 5 November. Agriculture and forestry are also major local employers. Drumnadrochit is the home of the Hanging Tree Brewery, a microbrewery launched in 2018. Drumnadrochit is also home to Cobbs Cakes traditionally made and distributed across the UK and Ireland. Cobbs is also the largest employer in the village, running the Drumnadrochit Hotel and the Clansman Visitor Centre, and recently bought the Loch Ness Beer brand after the Brewery went into administration in 2016. In popular culture[edit] Drumnadrochit is featured in Scooby-Doo! and the Loch Ness Monster as the closest town to Blake Castle, the ancestral home of Daphne Blake's Scottish side of the family. When first driving into the town, Fred Jones mispronounces the name while Scooby-Doo says it correctly. See also[edit] Balnain Charles Kennedy MP Gallery[edit] Drumnadrochit in 1998.
