Lillooet /ˈlɪloʊɛt/, known in the language itself as St̓át̓imcets / Sƛ’aƛ’imxǝc ([ˈst͡ɬʼæt͡ɬʼjəmxət͡ʃ]), is the language of the St’át’imc, a Salishan language of the Interior branch spoken in southern British Columbia, Canada, around the middle Fraser and Lillooet Rivers. The language of the Lower Lillooet people uses the name Ucwalmícwts,[3] because St̓át̓imcets means "the language of the people of Sat̓", i.e. the Upper Lillooet of the Fraser River. Lillooet is an endangered language with as few as 200 native speakers practically all of whom are over 60 years of age (Gordon 2005).

Lower St̓át̓imcets is spoken around Mount Currie and neighboring areas. An additional subdialect called Skookumchuck is spoken within the Lower St̓át̓imcets dialect area, but there is no information available in van Eijk (1981, 1997) (which are the main references for this article). A common usage used by the bands of the Lower Lillooet River below Lillooet Lake is Ucwalmicwts. The "Clao7alcw" (Raven's Nest) language nest program at Mount Currie, home of the Lil’wat, is conducted in the Lil̓wat language and was the focus of Onowa McIvor's Master's thesis.[4] As of 2014, "the Coastal Corridor Consortium— an entity made up of board members from First Nations and educational partners to improve aboriginal access to and performance in postsecondary education and training— ... [has] developed a Lil’wat-language program."[5] Phonology[edit] Consonants[edit] St̓át̓imcets has 44 consonants: Analysis of van Eijk (1997) Bilabial Dental Postalv. /Palatal Velar Post- velar Glottal central lateral retracted lateral plain retracted plain labial plain labial Stop plain p t t͡ʃ t͡ʂ k kʷ q qʷ glottalized pʼ t͡sʼ t͡ɬʼ kʼ kʷʼ q͡χʼ q͡χʷʼ ʔ Fricative ɬ ʃ ʂ x xʷ χ χʷ Nasal plain m n glottalized ˀm ˀn Approximant plain z l ḻ j ɰ ɰʷ ʕ ʕʷ h glottalized zʼ ˀl ˀḻ ˀj ɰʼ ɰʷʼ ʕʼ ʕʷʼ Obstruents consist of the stops, affricates, and fricatives. There are 22 obstruents. Sonorants consist of the nasals and approximants. There are 22 sonorants. Glottalized stops are pronounced as ejective consonants. Glottalized sonorants are pronounced with creaky voice: /ˀn/ = [n̰]. The glottalized consonants of St'at'imcets contrast not only with plain consonants, but also with sequences of plain consonant + glottal stop, or glottalized consonant + glottal stop, in either order. This holds for both the obstruents and the sonorants: [ɰʷ] ≠ [ɰʷʼ] ≠ [ɰʔʷ] ≠ [ɰʷʔ] ≠ [ʔɰʷʼ] ≠ [ɰʷʼʔ] and [k] ≠ [kʼ] ≠ [ʔk] ≠ [kʔ] ≠ [ʔkʼ] ≠ [kʼʔ]. The dental approximants /z, zʼ/ are pronounced alternatively as interdental fricatives [ð, ð̰] or as dental fricatives [z̪, z̪̰], depending on the dialect of St'at'imcets. There are four pairs of retracted and nonretracted consonants (which alternate morphophonemically). Retraction on consonants is essentially velarization, although additionally, nonretracted /t͡ʃ/ is phonetically laminal [t͡ʃ̻] whereas retracted /t͡ʃ̠/ is apical [t͡ʂ̺]. (St'at'imcets has retracted-nonretracted vowel pairs.) /t͡ʃ/ - /t͡ʃ̠/ /ʃ/ - /ʃ̠/ /l/ - /ḻ/ /lʼ/ - /ḻʼ/ Among the post-velar consonants, the obstruents /q, qʷ, q͡χʼ, q͡χʷʼ, χ, χʷ/ are all post-velar (pre-uvular) [k̠, k̠ʷ, k̠͡x̠ʼ, k̠͡x̠ʷʼ, x̠, x̠ʷ] whereas the approximants [ʕ, ʕʷ, ʕʼ, ʕʷʼ] are either pharyngeal or true uvulars. Vowels[edit] St'at'imcets has 8 vowels: Front Central Back non- retracted retracted non- retracted retracted non- retracted retracted High e   [e] e̠   [ɛ] o   [o] o̠   [ɔ] Mid ə   [ə] ə̠   [ʌ] Low a   [ɛ] a̠   [a] The phonetic realization of the phonemes are indicated in brackets to the right. All retracted vowels are indicated by a line under the vowel. These retracted vowels alternate morphophonemically. (Note that St'at'imcets also has retracted consonants.) The non-retracted vowel /a/ ranges from [ɛ~æ]. Because retracted /e̠/ and non-retracted /a/ can both pronounced [ɛ], there is often phonetic overlap. Phonological processes[edit] epenthetic /ə/. Post-velar Harmony (retraction): Within roots, there is a restriction that all consonant and vowel retracted-nonretracted pairs must be of the same type. That is, a root may not contain both a retracted and a nonretracted vowel or consonant. This is a type of Retracted Tongue Root harmony (also called pharyngeal harmony) involving both vowels and consonants that is an areal feature of this region of North America, shared by other Interior Salishan and non-Salishan languages (for example see Chilcotin vowel flattening). In addition to the root harmony restriction, some suffixes harmonize with the root to which they are attached. For instance, the inchoative suffix /-ɣʷélʼx/ -wil’c: ama "good" /ʔáma/ + /-ɣʷélʼx/ → /ʔamaɣʷélʼx/ [ʔɛmɛɣʷél̰x] amawíl’c  "to get better" qvḻ "bad" /qʌḻ/ + /-ɣʷélʼx/ → /qʌḻɣʷé̠ḻʼx/ [qaɫɣʷɛ́ɫ̰x] qvḻwíiḻʼc  "to get spoiled" Orthography[edit] There are two orthographies,[6] one based on Americanist Phonetic Notation that was developed by the Mount Currie School and used by the Lillooet Council, and a modification by Bouchard that is used by the Upper St̓át̓imc Language, Culture and Education Society.[7] The latter orthography is unusual in that /tɬʼ/ is written ⟨t̓⟩.

St̓át̓imcets, like the other Salishan languages, exhibits predicate/argument flexibility. All full words are able to occur in the predicate (including words with typically 'nouny' meanings such as nk̓yap 'coyote', which in the predicate essentially means 'to be a coyote') and any full word is able to appear in an argument, even those that seem "verby", such as t̓ak 'go along', which as a noun, is equivalent the noun phrase 'one that goes along'.[8] Sentence T̓ak ti nk̓yápa. Morphemes t̓ak ti- nk̓yap -a Gloss go.along DET- coyote -DET Parts Predicate Subject Translation The/a coyote goes along. Sentence Nḱyáp ti t̓aka. Morphemes nk̓yap ti- t̓ak -a Gloss coyote DET- go.along -DET Parts Predicate Subject Translation The one going along is a coyote. Reduplication[edit] St̓át̓imcets, as is typical of the Salishan family, has several types of reduplication (and triplication) that have a range of functions such as expressing plural, diminutive, aspect, etc.     Initial reduplication:     kl̓ácw 'muskrat' → kl̓ekl̓ácw 'muskrats' Plural     stálhlec 'standing up' → státalhlec 'to keep standing up' Continuative (has s- prefix, stem: -tálhlec)     sráp 'tree' → srepráp 'trees' Collective/Plural (stem: -rap)     snúk̓wa7 'friend/relative' → snek̓wnúk̓wa7 'friends/relatives' Collective/Plural (stem: -núk̓wa7)     Final reduplication/triplication:     p̓líxw 'boil over' → p̓líxwexw 'boiling over' Ongoing Action     p̓líxw 'boil over' → p̓lixwixwíxw 'to keep boiling over' Continuative/Intensive     lhésp 'rash' → lhéslhsep 'rash all over' Collective/Plural (stem: lhes-) (the e before -p is epenthetic) A more complicated type of reduplication is the internal reduplication used to express the diminutive. In this case the consonant before a stressed vowel is reduplicated after the stressed vowel and usually the vowel then changes to e (IPA: [ə]). Examples are below:     Internal reduplication:     naxwít 'snake' → naxwéxwt 'worm' (naxwé-xw-t)     sqáxa7 'dog' → sqéqxa7 'pup' (sqé-q-xa7)     sqláw̓ 'beaver' → sqlélew̓ 'little beaver' (sqlé-l-ew̓) (the extra e here is an epenthetic vowel) More than one reduplicative process can occur in a given word:   Diminutive Plural+Diminutive     sqáxa7 'dog' sqéqxa7 'pup' sqexqéqxa7 'pups'     s-qáxa7   s-qé-q-xa7   s-qex-qé-q-xa7   St’át’imcets has several other variants of the above types. Reduplication is further complicated by consonant glottalization (see van Eijk (1997) for details). Mood and modality[edit] The subjunctive mood appears in nine distinct environments, with a range of semantic effects, including: weakening an imperative to a polite request, turning a question into an uncertainty statement, creating an ignorance free relative. The St̓át̓imcets subjunctive also differs from Indo-European subjunctives in that it is not selected by attitude verbs. St̓át̓imcets has a complex system of subject and object agreement. There are different subject agreement paradigms for transitive vs. intransitive predicates. For intransitive predicates, there are three distinct subject paradigms, one of which is glossed as 'subjunctive' by van Eijk (1997) and Davis (2006) Sample text[edit] The following is a portion of a story in van Eijk (1981:87) told by Rosie Joseph of Mount Currie. St̓át̓imcets: Nilh aylh lts7a sMáma ti húz̓a qweqwl̓el̓tmínan. N̓as ku7 ámlec áku7 tsípunsa. Nilh t̓u7 st̓áksas ti xláka7sa. Tsicw áku7, nilh t̓u7 ses wa7, kwánas et7ú i sqáwtsa.

She went that way to get some food from her roothouse. So she took along her bucket. She got there, and she stayed around, taking potatoes. She was doing that, and then a mouse ran by there. So she grabbed it, she squeezed it. So she said: "You get all squashed now!" So she opened her hand and she let go of what turned out to be a potato, it was a rotten potato that she had caught....
