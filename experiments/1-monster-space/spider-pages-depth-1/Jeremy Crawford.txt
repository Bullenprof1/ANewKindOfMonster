Contents 1 Career 2 Works 3 References 4 External links Career[edit] Jeremy Crawford co-designed and edited the Blue Rose role-playing game along with Steve Kenson (2005). He was hired by Wizards of the Coast in 2007 as a game designer for their flagship Dungeons & Dragons product, and has worked there since then. His Dungeons & Dragons design credits include Player's Handbook 2 (2009),[1] Dungeon Master's Kit (2010), and Heroes of the Fallen Lands (2010). He was the Rules Manager for the 4th Edition of Dungeons & Dragons. Development on a new edition started in 2011 and Crawford became the Co-Lead Designer, along with Mike Mearls, of the 5th Edition of Dungeons & Dragons. Crawford also became the Lead Rules Developer and Managing Editor of the edition.[2] Under Crawford and Mearls, there became a concerted effort to boost inclusiveness both in the game and in the development of the game.[3] The 5th Edition version of the game credits women as contributors to its design more than any previous one: about 26 percent are female, as opposed to 20 percent in 4th Edition and 12 percent in 3rd Edition.[4] He is credited as one of the authors of the Player's Handbook for the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons, along with several other books in the edition.[5] He also authors the monthly "Sage Advice" newsletter.[6] Works[edit] Title Game Credits Date ISBN Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Warhammer Fantasy RPG 2nd Edition Designer 2005 978-1844162208 Blue Rose Blue
