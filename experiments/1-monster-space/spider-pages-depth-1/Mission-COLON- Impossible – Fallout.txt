It is the sixth installment in the Mission: Impossible film series, and the second film to be directed by McQuarrie following the 2015 film Rogue Nation, making him the first director to direct more than one film in the franchise. The cast includes Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Michelle Monaghan, and Alec Baldwin all of whom reprise their roles from the previous films, along with Henry Cavill, Vanessa Kirby, and Angela Bassett, who join the franchise. In the film, Ethan Hunt and his team must track down missing plutonium while being monitored by a CIA agent after a mission goes wrong. Talks for a sixth Mission: Impossible film began prior to the release of Rogue Nation in 2015. The film was officially announced in November 2015, with McQuarrie confirming his return as writer and director, as well as producer alongside J. J. Abrams and Cruise, the seventh collaboration between the pair. Jeremy Renner confirmed that he was unable to appear in the film due to scheduling conflicts with Avengers: Endgame. Filming took place from April 2017 to March 2018, in Paris, London, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Arab Emirates. Production was notably put on-hold for two months following an injury to Cruise in August 2017. Mission: Impossible – Fallout had its world premiere in Paris on July 12, 2018, and was released in the United States on July 27, 2018; it was the first in the series to be released in RealD 3D, and also had an IMAX release. It grossed $791 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of Cruise's career, and the highest-grossing film in the franchise, surpassing Ghost Protocol. It received critical acclaim for its direction, screenplay, cinematography, action sequences, stunts, musical score, and acting, and is considered by many critics to be the best installment in the franchise.[4][5] Two untitled sequels, one of them being Mission: Impossible 7, are both scheduled to be released in May 2022 and July 2023, respectively, both directed by McQuarrie.[6] Contents 1 Plot 2 Cast 3 Production 3.1 Pre-production 3.2 Filming 3.3 Visual effects 4 Soundtrack 5 Release 5.1 Home media 6 Reception 6.1 Box office 6.2 Critical response 7 Accolades 8 Sequels 9 References 10 External links Plot[edit] Two years after anarchist Solomon Lane's capture, the remnants of his organization of rogue clandestine operatives, the Syndicate, continue to wreak havoc around the globe and have reorganized as a terrorist group known as the Apostles. They are allied with a mysterious extremist known as John Lark, who wrote a manifesto calling for the destruction of the current world order. At a safe house in Belfast, IMF agent Ethan Hunt is assigned to buy three stolen plutonium cores in Berlin from Eastern European gangsters, before the Apostles can. He is joined by Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell for the mission, but the team fails when Stickell is captured. Hunt's attempt to save Stickell allows agents of the arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis (aka the White Widow) to seize the plutonium. The IMF team later captures nuclear weapons expert Nils Delbruuk, whose security clearance was revoked due to his anti-religious bigotry, and who designed nuclear bombs for the Apostles. Delbruuk explains the Apostles' credo that "there has never been great peace without first a great suffering. The greater the suffering, the greater the peace." Using a fake broadcast of Dunn posing as Wolf Blitzer, they trick Delbruuk into unlocking a phone that he used to communicate with Lark. Furious at the IMF's failure to secure the plutonium, CIA Director Erika Sloane instructs Special Activities Division operative August Walker to shadow Hunt as he attempts to retrieve it. Hunt and Walker infiltrate a nightclub party in Paris where Lark is believed to be buying the cores from Mitsopolis, who is acting as the middleman in the sale of the plutonium. They track a man whom they suspect to be Lark, but after fighting him in a restroom, the man is killed by MI6 agent Ilsa Faust. Hunt assumes the role of Lark without a disguise and escapes from hitmen sent to kill both Lark and Mitsopolis. In exchange for the plutonium, Mitsopolis tasks Hunt with extracting Lane from an armored convoy moving through Paris. She provides one of the plutonium cores as a down payment. To prevent Mitsopolis and her brother Zola from killing local police, Hunt and Walker preemptively attack the convoy. Ramming Lane's vehicle into water, they lead police and Mitsopolis's men on a chase across Paris while Dunn and Stickell, in a watercraft, secure Lane. Faust reappears and attempts to kill Lane to prove her loyalty to MI6, but the extraction is successful. Mitsopolis instructs Hunt to deliver both Lane and Faust to London. At a London safe house, IMF Secretary Alan Hunley reveals evidence doctored by Walker and passed to Sloane, stating Hunt is the real Lark. Eventually, Hunt, the team, and Hunley trick Walker into admitting he is the real Lark and inform Sloane, who sends in a CIA unit to take everyone into custody for transfer to Washington, D.C. However, the CIA unit had been infiltrated by the Apostles, and Walker orders the infiltrators to attack, killing every other operator in the CIA unit. Walker kills Hunley and escapes after Hunt chases him across London. As he departs for India with Lane, Walker instructs Hunt to turn himself in and admit that he is Lark or else Hunt's ex-wife Julia will be harmed. The team deduces that Lane and Walker plan to detonate the remaining two nuclear bombs at a medical camp over the Siachen Glacier, contaminating the water supply of India, Pakistan, and China; with a third of its population affected, the world will descend into an anarchy from which the Apostles hope a new world order will emerge. As the bombs are linked by a failsafe, any attempt to defuse one bomb without the detonator automatically triggers the other. Upon arrival in Kashmir, Hunt discovers Julia and her new husband Erik are assigned to the medical camp, an arrangement made by Walker to increase the pressure on Hunt. Lane programs the bombs' detonator with a 15-minute countdown and gives it to Walker, choosing to remain behind with the bombs. Walker takes off, secretly pursued by Hunt while Dunn, Stickell, and Faust try to find and defuse the nuclear weapons. Stickell attempts to deactivate the first bomb with Julia's help, but they are unable to without the detonator. Faust and Dunn find the second bomb and are ambushed by Lane and subdue him after an intense fight. Following an aerial chase, Hunt uses a commandeered helicopter to ram Walker's helicopter out of the sky. After a fight on a cliff, Walker is killed. Hunt then secures the detonator, allowing the team to deactivate the nukes. In the aftermath, Sloane hands Lane over to MI6 through Mitsopolis, with Faust earning her exoneration. Julia tells Hunt that he has given her the best life, despite his commitment to the IMF. Faust and the team join Hunt in celebration.

Production[edit] Pre-production[edit] On May 23, 2015, The Tracking Board reported that Paramount Pictures was developing a sixth Mission: Impossible film, with Tom Cruise, J. J. Abrams, David Ellison, and Dana Goldberg returning to produce, along with Don Granger and Matt Grimm as executive producers, and Elizabeth Raposo overseeing development.[7] On July 28, 2015, Cruise confirmed on The Daily Show that a sixth film was already being developed, and told its host Jon Stewart that the filming would "probably" commence in summer 2016.[8] On August 2, 2015, Paramount executive Rob Moore told Variety that the sequel was already in the works, stating that they were "very happy to be developing this movie with Tom," and "there has to be another movie."[9] On November 19, 2015, it was announced that Paramount had again hired Christopher McQuarrie to write the film, while it was possible that he would also direct again, and the studio was moving fast, with plans to begin shooting in August 2016.[10] On November 30, 2015, McQuarrie confirmed through his Twitter account that he would be back for directing duty as well, and also produce the film along with Cruise.[11][12] On August 19, 2016, The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Paramount had halted pre-production on the film due to a dispute over salary between Cruise and the studio, as Cruise wanted to be paid equal to or more than his fee for the Universal Pictures film The Mummy.[13] On September 16, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that Cruise's dispute with the studio had been resolved, and production would now begin in spring 2017.[14] In November, Jeremy Renner—who portrayed William Brandt in the fourth and fifth films—stated that he was unsure if he would be part of the sixth film, due to scheduling conflicts with his role as Hawkeye in Marvel Studios' Avengers: Endgame (2019).[15] In March 2017, it was confirmed at CinemaCon that he would not return for the sixth film.[16] In February, McQuarrie revealed that the film would include more backstory to Ethan Hunt's personal life.[17] On June 13, 2017, Michelle Monaghan was announced to return as Ethan Hunt's wife Julia Meade-Hunt.[18] Filming[edit] Filming was slated to start in Paris on April 10, 2017.[19] Other locations included London, New Zealand and Norway.[20][21] Filming officially began on April 8.[22] Some of the filming also took place in New Zealand in July 2017.[23] The municipality of Forsand in Norway allowed the closing of Preikestolen for a time in autumn for the film's shoot; only crew members and cast were allowed to approach the mountain for nine consecutive days. They also were allowed up to 50 helicopter landings per day.[24] The scenes set in the Indian-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir were shot in New Zealand. Director Christopher McQuarrie said that he wanted the climax of the film to be set in a more "politically complex" location than New Zealand, so he chose to set this sequence in Kashmir.[25] In August 2017, Cruise injured his right leg on the London set during filming.[26][27][28] Following the accident, the studio announced it would halt production for at least nine weeks in order for Cruise's broken ankle and other injuries to heal, but released a statement saying that they would be keeping the July 2018 release date for the film. The injury resulted in a cost of around $80 million for the studio because they had to pay the cast and crew for the eight-week hiatus so they would not take another job. However, the injury and subsequent costs were offset by insurance, and did not count against the film's final budget.[29] Filming resumed in early October 2017, with Cruise spotted on the set seven weeks after his initial injury, and two weeks earlier than initially planned.[30] Reshoots for Cavill's Justice League coincided with the schedule for Fallout, for which he had grown a mustache which he was contracted to keep while filming. While McQuarrie initially gave the producers of Justice League permission to have Cavill shave the mustache in exchange for the $3 million it would cost to shut down production on Fallout and then digitally fill the mustache in, executives from Paramount rejected the idea,[31] forcing Justice League's VFX team to use special effects to digitally remove the mustache in post-production.[32] On January 25, 2018, the title was revealed to be Mission: Impossible – Fallout.[33] Filming wrapped in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on March 25, 2018.[34] Production in the UAE included filming of a High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) jump scene with Cruise. The scene required Cruise and the crew to train on a ground-based vertical wind tunnel, and then use a C-17 military aircraft to make over one hundred jumps from around 25,000 feet (7,600 m) to end up with three takes that McQuarrie wanted for the film. As the scene was to be set near sunset, they could only make one jump a day to try to get each shot.[35][36] One of the biggest challenges for the visual effects team was replacing the Abu Dhabi desert with Paris, which is where the jump takes place in the film. Artists re-created the Grand Palais des Champs-Élysées using reference imagery, Lidar scans, and photogrammetry from drone footage that was taken above the building.[37] Visual effects[edit] The visual effects were provided by DNEG and Blind LTD and supervised by Huw Evans, Andrew Booth and Jody Johnson with the help of One of Us and The Third Floor.[38] Soundtrack[edit] Mission: Impossible – Fallout: Music from the Motion Picture Soundtrack album by Lorne Balfe Released July 14, 2018 (2018-07-14) Recorded 2018 Genre Film score Length 1:35:45 Label La-La Land Records Paramount Music Producer Lorne Balfe, Queenie Li Lorne Balfe chronology Pacific Rim: Uprising (2018) Mission: Impossible – Fallout: Music from the Motion Picture (2018) Georgetown (2019) Mission: Impossible chronology Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation: Music from the Motion Picture (2015) Mission: Impossible – Fallout: Music from the Motion Picture (2018) Mission: Impossible 7 – The Album (2021) The musical score for Mission: Impossible – Fallout was composed by Lorne Balfe. Balfe was confirmed by McQuarrie to be the composer for the film in April 2018, replacing the previous composer Joe Kraemer.[39] The score has been praised by many critics, calling it an epic and inspiring score, with some powerful themes which are balanced with softer more sentimental themes;[40] some also considered it being too "Nolan-esque", comparing it to scores by Hans Zimmer (particularly The Dark Knight Rises).[41] The score implements the use of percussion, snares, and bongos to create a jaunty staccato momentum. The digital album was released through Paramount Music on July 14, 2018. The physical soundtrack was released later in the month by La-La Land Records. All music is composed by Lorne Balfe.

To the Movies, and was projected to gross $48–65 million in its opening weekend, with some estimates going as high as $75 million. It opened in 4,386 theaters, the most ever for the franchise and the seventh-widest release of all time.[49][50] The film made $6 million from Thursday night previews (including $1 million from IMAX screenings), the highest of the series, a record for Cruise, and a 50% increase from Rogue Nation's $4 million. It went on to debut to $61.2 million, the best of the series and the second-highest of Cruise's career.[46][51] It made $35.3 million in its second weekend to remain in first and marked the best sophomore frame of the franchise.[52] The film made $19.4 million in its third weekend, finishing second behind newcomer The Meg.[53] In other territories, the film was projected to debut to $75–80 million from 36 countries, for an estimated total global opening of around $135 million.[54] It made $15 million on its first day, including $2.8 million in South Korea.[43] The film ended up overperforming, debuting to $92 million overseas for a worldwide total of $153.5 million.

Critical response[edit] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 427 reviews and an average rating of 8.40/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Fast, sleek, and fun, Mission: Impossible – Fallout lives up to the 'impossible' part of its name by setting yet another high mark for insane set pieces in a franchise full of them."[56] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 86 out of 100, based on 60 critics, indicating "universal acclaim."[57] Audiences polled by PostTrak gave the film an 84% overall positive score and a 65% "definite recommend," while CinemaScore reported filmgoers gave it an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, the highest ever for the series.[46] Variety's Peter Debruge called the film "the series' most exciting installment yet," saying, "McQuarrie clearly believes in creating coherent set pieces: His combat scenes are tense, muscular, and clean, shot and edited in such a way that the spatial geography makes sense."[58] David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a grade of "A" and called it one of the best action films ever, writing "He's only Tom Cruise because nobody else is willing to be—or maybe he's only Tom Cruise so that nobody else has to be. Either way, Fallout is the film he's always promised us, and it is worth the wait."[59] Entertainment Weekly's Chris Nashawaty also gave the film an "A" grade, commenting on Cruise that "He's still Hollywood's hungriest movie star", with the series getting "better, twistier and more deliriously fun with each installment".[60] George Simpson of The Express complimented "the action is brutal and gut-punching, the pacing heart-pumping and the stakes so high it's gasp-inducing at times," adding, "Fallout is an improvement on all the previous films' failings, drawing together all the best aspects of them; simultaneously giving off that classic vibe of the original while never being afraid to continually evolve;" he gave the film five out of five stars.[61] The Telegraph's Tim Robey summed up the film as "spectacular and eye-popping," deeming it "the blockbuster of the summer" with "a pleasingly sinuous plot," and calling the film and its series a "Bond-like franchise"; he also rated the film five out of five stars.[62] Robert Abele of TheWrap described Cruise as an "evergreen movie star with the daredevil heart of a stuntman" and that he "puts every ounce of effort he can into the long, hard work of maintaining a blockbuster franchise."[63] The Hollywood Reporter's Todd McCarthy praised director Christopher McQuarrie, saying that with Mission: Impossible – Fallout he "tops what he did with Cruise three years ago," and also singled out Vanessa Kirby for playing her character with "a mix of elegance and frisky abandon."[64] J.R. Kinnard of PopMatters wrote, "Though it lacks the gritty humanity of something like George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), Mission: Impossible – Fallout is no less impressive in its dedication to character-driven action and practical special effects. It's a dazzling, non-stop thriller that's sure to become an instant action classic."[65] Screen Daily's Tim Grierson wrote "Tom Cruise is on fighting form in this thrilling franchise topper... [he is] ageless, riveting and seemingly unstoppable," further adding that "the sixth film in the series is among the most outstanding, delivering a near-exhausting amount of stupendous action sequences paired with deft character drama and the requisite life-or-death stakes."[66] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars, saying "there isn't as much [humor] in the dialogue as before," but added, "Crashes and petrolhead spills are what this franchise is reasonably expected to deliver. And this is what it cheerfully does."[67] Sight & Sound's Nick Pinkerton wrote "A strong contender for the most consistently cinematic franchise of the last 25 years, the Mission: Impossible films also offer a case study in the idea of the actor as auteur, with Tom Cruise continuing to present himself as a fearless screen immortal in Fallout."[68] The film was listed in 53 critics Top 10 films of 2018.
