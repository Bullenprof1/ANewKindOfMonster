Greyhawk Gary Gygax, Robert J. Kuntz 1975 68 The first supplement for the original D&D game, Greyhawk focused primarily on rules and removed the game's dependence on the Chainmail rules. Despite the name, the Greyhawk supplement was not intended as a setting supplement, but rather featured rules used in Gary Gygax's Greyhawk campaign.[1] Blackmoor Dave Arneson 1975 60 The second supplement for the original D&D game, Blackmoor added rules, monsters, treasure and is notable for containing the first published adventure for a role-playing game - "Temple of the Frog". Like Greyhawk, its focus was more on rules than setting material, despite the name.[2] Eldritch Wizardry Gary Gygax, Brian Blume 1976 60 Eldritch Wizardry was the third supplement for the original D&D game and is most notable for introducing some of its most famous monsters, such as demons and mind flayers.[3] Gods, Demi-Gods & Heroes Robert Kuntz, James M. Ward 1976 72 Gods, Demi-Gods & Heroes was the fourth supplement for the original D&D game and adapted a variety of real-world and fictional pantheons for use in the D&D game.[3] Swords & Spells Gary Gygax 1976 45 The fifth and final supplement for the original D&D game focused on providing a new diceless set of rules for large battles between armies.[3] Gods, Demi-Gods & Heroes stated itself to be the "last supplement"[4] for D&D in its introduction, and Swords & Spells did not have the official "Supplement V" designation on the cover. Basic Dungeons & Dragons[edit] The Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set was the successor to original Dungeons & Dragons and was released while TSR, Inc. was working on the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons set. This set was the beginning of the split into two separate games, driven by disagreements on the direction the game should take. The Basic set retained the simplicity and flexibility of the original game while Gary Gygax took Advanced Dungeons & Dragons in a more structured and complicated direction.[5] Initially it was expected that players would start using Basic edition and then graduate to Advanced Dungeons & Dragons.[6] However, in 1981 the Basic Set underwent a complete revision and not long after this the Expert Set was released for the first time. All references to a progression from the Basic Set to Advanced Dungeons & Dragons were removed from the games and supplements as TSR, Inc. made clear that the expected progression was from the Basic Set to the Expert Set. From this point the D&D dichotomy became fixed and the Basic/Expert pair were considered a completely separate game from Advanced Dungeons & Dragons.[7] Core products Title Author(s) Date Item # Contents Basic Set 1977Basic Set John Eric Holmes 1977 TSR 1001 Rulebook & misc. items (changed throughout printing) Basic Set 1981Basic Set Tom Moldvay 1981 TSR 1011 Expert Set David Cook 1981 TSR 1012 Basic Set 1983Basic Set Frank Mentzer 1983 TSR 1011 Expert Set Frank Mentzer 1983 TSR 1012 Companion Set Frank Mentzer 1984 TSR 1013 Master Rules Frank Mentzer 1985 TSR 1021 Immortals Rules Frank Mentzer 1986 TSR 1017 The New Easy-to-Master Dungeons & Dragons Game Troy Denning April 1991 TSR 1070 Dungeons & Dragons Rules Cyclopedia Aaron Allston, Steven E.

Heard 1993 Boxed set TSR 1094 - Advanced Dungeons & Dragons[edit] Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) greatly expanded upon the rules and settings of the original D&D game when it was released in 1977. As such, this edition saw the publication of numerous books to assist players. The naming of the core books in this edition became the standard for all later editions. Around 1983, books such as MM, PHB, DMG and DDG, all previous hardcover releases except Fiend Folio, were upgraded with new cover art and unified in "orange spine" look. This included only minimal text change such as removal of rape references in DMG (books are now labeled "ages 10 and up"). MM2 and the rest of the series followed the same format. By the end of its first decade, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons line had expanded to a library of 14 hardcover rulebooks, including three books of monsters, and two books governing character skills in wilderness and underground settings.

Initially, the second edition would consolidate the game, with two essential hardcovers and a 3-ring monster document binder that Dungeon Masters can sort contents as they wish. Periodically, TSR published 3 lines of optional rulebooks (PHBR/DMGR/HR) and additional monster compendium to enhance game play. However, by popular demand TSR released a hardcover monster book in 1993. Also by 1995, with power creep from optional classes and races becoming prominent, they were forced to abandon their original plan and revise the entire line.[8] Core rules were rewritten, reorganized and accompanied with new logo, new art and black bordered cover style but had only a few meaningful rule changes. Optional rules were also revised and reorganized in hardcover books in the same look.

As the Basic game had been discontinued some years earlier, and the more straightforward title was more marketable, the word "Advanced" was dropped and the new edition was called just Dungeons & Dragons, but was still officially referred to as 3rd edition (or 3E for short). This edition was the first to be released by Wizards of the Coast after their acquisition of the company, as well as the first to allow third-party companies to make supplemental materials by use of the Open Game License. A series of Map Folios were also produced. In July 2003, a revised version of the 3rd edition D&D rules (termed version 3.5) was released that incorporated numerous rule changes, as well as expanding the Dungeon Master's Guide and Monster Manual.
