Polymatheia (Greek: Πολυμάθεια) in Greek mythology was one of the three Muses recognized at Sicyon, as remarked by Plutarch.[1] Her name literally means "much knowledge, erudition", and Plutarch compares her to Polymnia to whom he ascribes precedence over accumulation and preservation of knowledge.
