The main myth concerning them is envisioned to account for their collective name and to provide an etiology for their weepy raininess: Hyas was killed in a hunting accident and the Hyades wept from their grief.[5][8] They were changed into a cluster of stars, the Hyades, set in the head of Taurus.[9] Their number varies from three in the earliest sources to fifteen in the late ones. The names are also variable, according to the mythographer, and include: Comparative table of Hyade's names, number and family Relation Name Sources Hes.[10] Thales Eurip. Dio.
