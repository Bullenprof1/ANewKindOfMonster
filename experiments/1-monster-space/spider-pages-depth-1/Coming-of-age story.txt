In genre studies, a coming-of-age story is a genre of literature, film, and video that focuses on the growth of a protagonist from childhood to adulthood ("coming of age"). Coming-of-age stories tend to emphasize dialogue or internal monologue over action, and are often set in the past. The subjects of coming-of-age stories are typically teenagers.[1] The Bildungsroman is a specific subgenre of coming-of-age story. The plot points of coming of age stories are usually emotional changes within the character(s) in question.[2] Contents 1 In literature 2 In film and television 3 In video games 4 References In literature[edit] The Telemachy in Homer's Odyssey (8th century BC) Hayy ibn Yaqdhan, by Ibn Tufail (12th century)[3] The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, by Henry Fielding (1749)[4] The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, by Laurence Sterne (1759)[4] Candide, by Voltaire (1759) Northanger Abbey, by Jane Austen (1817) Oliver Twist, by Charles Dickens (1837–1839) Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens (1860–1861) Little Women, by Louisa May Alcott (1868–1869) Little Men, by Louisa May Alcott (1871) The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, by Mark Twain (1876) The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain (1884–1885) The Red Badge of Courage, by Stephen Crane (1894–1895) The Blue Lagoon, by Henry De Vere Stacpoole (1908) A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce (1916)[5] All Quiet on the Western Front, by Erich Maria Remarque (1929) A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, by Betty Smith (1943) Johnny Tremain, by Esther Forbes (1943) The Catcher in the Rye, by J.

(October 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In film, coming-of-age is a genre of teen films. Coming-of-age films focus on the psychological and moral growth or transition of a protagonist from youth to adulthood. Personal growth and change is an important characteristic of this genre, which relies on dialogue and emotional responses, rather than action. The story is sometimes told in the form of a flashback.[1] Historically, coming-of-age films usually centred on young boys, although coming-of-age films focusing on girls have become more common in the early 21st century, such as Lady Bird and Sweet 20 (2017).[7] Films in this subgenre include: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938) Babes in Arms (1939) The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1939) The Wizard of Oz (1939) Pinocchio (1940) Bambi (1942) The Human Comedy (1943) A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945) Great Expectations (1946) Oliver Twist (1948) The Blue Lagoon (1949) The Red Badge of Courage (1951) East of Eden (1955) Rebel Without a Cause (1955) The Apu Trilogy (1955–59) Johnny Tremain (1957) The 400 Blows (1959) To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) David and Lisa (1962) Oliver!
