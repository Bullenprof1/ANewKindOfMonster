However Tugarin is defeated due to rain, which spoils his papery wings.[1] Combat with Alyosha[edit] Further information: Alyosha Popovich Tugarin Zmeyevich is best known from the bylina about his duel with Alyosha Popovich, which comes in many different versions.[1] The story is also found in the prose fairytale version.[18][10] In some versions, they two meet for the duel at Safat River, where they pitch pavilions.[19] Tugarin roars in a booming voice,[19] or else hisses like a snake.[1] He is flying in the sky flapping his paper-like wings, which fail him when it rains. Alyosha Popovich wins the duel, cuts Tugarin's body into pieces and scatters them across the field.[1] Some bylinas mention Tugarin's intimate relations with the wife of knyaz Vladimir. When she finds out about his death, she turns sad and reproaches Alyosha Popovich for separating her from her "dear friend".[1] Other dragons[edit] Tugarin Zmeyevich is a chtonical character of an ancient dragon-fighting myth, related to Zmey Gorynych (Russian: “Змей Горыныч”, Ukrainian: “Змій Горинич”), Fiery Dragon (Russian: “Огненный Змей”) etc.[1] Explanatory notes[edit] ^ Related to verb tuzhit тужить "to grieve". ^ Alyosha plays a game with it by tossing the head onto his spear. This is seenfby Alyosha's follower at a distance. In one version, the follower is called Marýshko, and he announces it is Alyosha playing with the "little head".[16] ^ Of course, Aloyosha Popovich too has the "Son of Pope" byname, his father being called the "prebendary León" (or "Catheral priest Leontii"[10]) or "León the pope".[11] References[edit] Citations ^ a b c d e f g h i j "Тугарин" in Mythological Dictionary, E.
