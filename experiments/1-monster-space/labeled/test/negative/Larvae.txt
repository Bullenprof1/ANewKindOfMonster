Animals with indirect development such as insects, amphibians, or cnidarians typically have a larval phase of their life cycle. The larva's appearance is generally very different from the adult form (e.g. caterpillars and butterflies) including different unique structures and organs that do not occur in the adult form. Their diet may also be considerably different. Larvae are frequently adapted to environments separate from adults. For example, some larvae such as tadpoles live almost exclusively in aquatic environments, but can live outside water as adult frogs. By living in a distinct environment, larvae may be given shelter from predators and reduce competition for resources with the adult population. Animals in the larval stage will consume food to fuel their transition into the adult form. In some organisms like polychaetes and barnacles, adults are immobile but their larvae are mobile, and use their mobile larval form to distribute themselves.[1][2] Some larvae are dependent on adults to feed them. In many eusocial Hymenoptera species, the larvae are fed by female workers. In Ropalidia marginata (a paper wasp) the males are also capable of feeding larvae but they are much less efficient, spending more time and getting less food to the larvae.[3] The larvae of some organisms (for example, some newts) can become pubescent and do not develop further into the adult form. This is a type of neoteny.[4] Eurosta solidaginis Goldenrod Gall Fly larva It is a misunderstanding that the larval form always reflects the group's evolutionary history. This could be the case, but often the larval stage has evolved secondarily, as in insects.[5][6] In these cases the larval form may differ more than the adult form from the group's common origin.[7] Contents 1 Selected types of larvae 2 Insect larvae 3 See also 4 References 5 External links 6 Bibliography Selected types of larvae[edit] Animal Name of larvae Porifera (sponges) coeloblastula (= blastula, amphiblastula), parenchymula (= parenchymella, stereogastrula) Heterocyemida Wagener's larva Dicyemida infusoriform larva Cnidarians planula (= stereogastrula), actinula Ctenophora cydippid larvae Platyhelminthes Turbellaria: Müller's larva, Götte’s larva; Trematoda: miracidium, sporocyst, redia, cercaria; Monogenea: oncomiracidium; Cestoda: cysticercus, cysticercoid, oncosphere (or hexacanth), coracidium, plerocercoid Annelida nectochaete, polytroch Nematoda Dauer larva, microfilaria Sipuncula pelagosphera larva Ectoprocta cyphonautes, vesiculariform larvae Nematomorpha nematomorphan larva Phoronids actinotroch Cycliophora pandora, chordoid larva Nemertea pilidium, Iwata larva, Desor larva Acanthocephala acanthor Locifera Higgins larva Brachiopoda lobate larva Priapula loricate larva Certain molluscs, annelids, nemerteans and sipunculids trochophore Certain molluscs veliger Mollusca: freshwater Bivalvia (mussels) glochidium Arthropoda: †Trilobita protaspis (unjointed), meraspis (increasing number of joints, but 1 less than the holaspis), holaspis (=adult)[8] Arthropoda: Xiphosura euproöps larva ("trilobite larva") Arthropoda: Pycnogonida protonymphon Crustaceans General: nauplius, metanauplius, protozoea, antizoea, pseudozoea, zoea, postlarva, cypris, primary larva, mysis Decapoda: zoea Rhizocephala: kentrogon Insecta: Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) caterpillar Insecta: Beetles grub Insecta: Flies, Bees, Wasps maggot Insecta: Mosquitoes wriggler Deuterostomes dipleurula (hypothetical larva) Echinodermata bipinnaria, vitellaria, brachiollaria, pluteus, ophiopluteus, echinopluteus, auricularia Hemichordata tornaria Urochordata tadpole (does not feed, technically a "swimming embryo") Fish (generally) larva Fish: Petromyzontiformes (lamprey) ammocoete Fish: Anguilliformes (eels) leptocephalus Amphibians tadpole, polliwog Insect larvae[edit] The larvae of the Hercules beetle (Dynastes hercules) are among the largest of any species of insect Within Insects, only Endopterygotes show complete metamorphosis, including a distinct larval stage.[9][10] Several classifications have been suggested by many entomologists,[11][12] and following classification is based on Antonio Berlese classification in 1913. There are four main types of endopterygote larvae types:[13] Apodous larvae – no legs at all and are poorly sclerotized. Based on sclerotization, three apodous forms are recognized. Eucephalous – with well sclerotized head capsule. Found in Nematocera, Buprestidae and Cerambycidae families. Hemicephalus – with a reduced head capsule, retractable in to the thorax. Found in Tipulidae and Brachycera families. Acephalus – without head capsule. Found in Cyclorrhapha Protopod larvae – larva have many different forms and often unlike a normal insect form. They hatch from eggs which contains very little yolk. E.g. first instar larvae of parasitic hymenoptera. Polypod larvae – also known as eruciform larvae, these larva have abdominal prolegs, in addition to usual thoracic legs. They poorly sclerotized and relatively inactive. They live in close contact with the food. Best example is caterpillars of lepidopterans. Oligopod larvae – have well developed head capsule and mouthparts are similar to the adult, but without compound eyes. They have six legs. No abdominal prolegs. Two types can be seen: Campodeiform – well sclerotized, dorso-ventrally flattened body. Usually long legged predators with prognathous mouthparts. (lacewing, trichopterans, mayflies and some coleopterans). Scarabeiform – poorly sclerotized, flat thorax and abdomen. Usually short legged and inactive burrowing forms. (Scarabaeoidea and other coleopterans).
