Contents 1 History 2 See also 3 References 4 External links History[edit] The phrase originally expressed contempt, but by 1842 had acquired its modern meaning.[1][2][3] Early users of the phrase include Sir Walter Scott in his 1828 The Fair Maid of Perth. The physical act of putting one's tongue into one's cheek once signified contempt.[4] For example, in Tobias Smollett's The Adventures of Roderick Random, which was published in 1748, the eponymous hero takes a coach to Bath, and on the way, apprehends a highwayman. This provokes an altercation with a less brave passenger: He looked back and pronounced with a faltering voice, 'O! 'tis very well—damn my blood! I shall find a time.' I signified my contempt of him by thrusting my tongue in my cheek, which humbled him so much, that he scarce swore another oath aloud during the whole journey.[5] The phrase appears in 1828 in The Fair Maid of Perth by Sir Walter Scott: The fellow who gave this all-hail thrust his tongue in his cheek to some scapegraces like himself. It is not clear how Scott intended readers to understand the phrase.[1] The more modern ironic sense appeared in the 1842 poem "The Ingoldsby Legends" by the English clergyman Richard Barham, in which a Frenchman inspects a watch and cries: 'Superbe! Magnifique!' / (with his tongue in his cheek)[1] The ironic usage originates with the idea of suppressed mirth—biting one's tongue to prevent an outburst of laughter.[6] See also[edit] Slang dictionary References[edit] ^ a b c Owens, Gene (4 December 2007).
